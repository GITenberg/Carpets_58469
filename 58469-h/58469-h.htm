<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> treating of carpet manufacture, which involves the
employment of looms and other machinery of a complicated
nature, I was confronted with the problem,
how far it was necessary or desirable to explain and
illustrate mechanical devices. Upon consideration, it
seemed advisable, having regard to the scope of the
book, to avoid as far as possible both descriptions and
diagrams of a mechanical nature. A certain standard
of mechanical intelligence is assumed in the reader;
but this work, like the rest of the series, is intended for
the layman; and it is impossible to describe and explain
detailed mechanical movements except at considerable
length and with the aid of elaborate diagrams. Those
who wish to study the technique of the subject in detail
are referred to Mr. Fred Bradbury’s book, <span class='it'>Carpet
Manufacture</span> (F. King &amp; Sons, Ltd., Halifax, 1904),
which, though it has not been brought up to date, is
a classic for the trade, as all experts are aware. I am
indebted to him for the use of several blocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have also to acknowledge the courtesy of the
Gresham Publishing Co., Ltd., of Chandos Street,
Covent Garden, for permission to use a number of
blocks from their <span class='it'>Textile Industries</span>, which contains
some admirable chapters on Carpet Manufacture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My thanks are further due to <span class='it'>The Times</span> for permission
to utilise some contributions I made to their “Textile
Supplement,” published in 1913; while I have received
information and helpful criticism from Messrs. Woodward,
Grosvenor &amp; Co., Ltd., Messrs. T. &amp; A. Naylor,
<span class='pageno' title='iv' id='Page_iv'></span>
Ltd., The Victoria Carpet Co., not to mention colleagues
and foremen of my own Company, Brintons Limited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the historical chapter I am indebted to Mr.
A. C. Parry, and for particulars of Carpet Trades
Unions to Mr. E. Stradling, Mr. Ellis Crowther, and
Mr. T. Lindsay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am conscious of the possibility of errors and omissions,
and I should be grateful for any intimation of
such, with the view of making the necessary corrections,
if a further edition should be required.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HISTORY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Before</span> the mechanical processes involved in the
manufacture of carpets to-day are described, a short
sketch of the history of the fabric and the story of its
introduction into this country may be of interest.
The origin of the weaver’s loom, like that of the potter’s
wheel, dates back to the prehistoric times. A loom
with its workers is shown in an ancient Egyptian fresco,
the date of which is reckoned by antiquarians to be
about 3,000 years before the Christian Era. In the
grottoes of Benihassan, both spinners and weavers are
shown, the weavers working on cloths both plain and
of a checked pattern; and both perpendicular and horizontal
looms are represented. There were, however,
other civilisations beside the Egyptian; and the origin
of the carpet must be sought still further to the East,
in places where, in spite of the ebb and flow of conquests,
it is still made at the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mention is frequently found in ancient records of
history of rich hangings, coverings, fine cloths and
tapestries, generally the booty of some conqueror;
but it is difficult to tell whether some fabric used
exclusively as the carpet of to-day is used is included
in these lists. The ancient equivalent of the modern
carpet or rug was known to the Babylonians, who
were, according to Pliny, skilful weavers; and its manufacture
was carried on at an early date among the
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span>
Assyrians and Persians, in China and India, and among
the Arabs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original purpose of the carpet in the East was
probably the same in the beginning as it is there, now,
at the present day. It was used to give colour to the
temple, as a hanging for the tents, a trapping for the
saddle, a sitting place for the guest, for a covering of
the ground on which to sleep or pray; and its manufacture
in any district implied a certain degree of
civilisation and luxury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The use of a woven floor-covering seems to be
indicated in passages in Homer; and the well-known
authority, Sir George Birdwood, cites an account of
a banquet given at Alexandria in the third century
before the Christian Era by Ptolemy Philadelphus, at
which Persian rugs were spread in the King’s tent.
Persian carpets were highly valued, and were exported
to Greece, and at a later date to Rome. Themistocles,
according to Plutarch, “likened a man’s discourse to
a rich Persian carpet, the beautiful figures and patterns
of which can be shown only by spreading and extending
it out; when it is contracted and folded up, they are
obscured and lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conquests of Alexander the Great, which extended
as far as India, seem to have made the use of the
products of the Eastern looms familiar among the
Greeks. At a later date the conquests made by the
Roman Consuls spread the arts of the East still further
into Europe. At a later period still the taking of
Constantinople by the Turks drove many skilful artificers
to take up their residence in Italy at Venice, Genoa,
and Florence, and at some towns in France; and from
these centres carpets were still further distributed over
Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Crusades brought England into touch with the
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
East; and specimens of carpet were probably introduced
by returning knights and their followers; but it is through
Spain, a country which acquired the art from the Moors,
that they are first known to have come, Queen Eleanor
of Castille and her suite introducing them into this
country on her marriage to Edward I. Illustrations of
carpets are shown in pictures of the time of Henry VIII;
and in the time of Elizabeth they were probably in
more general use in England than most writers on the
subject are accustomed to allow; for direct communication
with the East had been opened up by the fearless
and enterprising traders and adventurers of those times.
In Hakluyt’s <span class='it'>Voyages</span> there are the following instructions
to a trader about to journey to Persia—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Persia you shall finde carpets of course thrummed
wooll, the best of the world, and excellently coloured;
those cities and townes you most repaire to, and you
must use meanes to learne all the order of the dying of
those thrummes, which are so died as neither raine,
wine, nor yet vinegar can staine; and if you may attaine
to that cunning you shall not need to feare dying of
clothe. For if the colour holde in yarne and thrumme,
it will holde much better in cloth. Learne you there
to fixe and make sure the colour to be given by logge
wood; so shall we not need to buy wood so deare to
the enriching of our enemies. Enquire the price of
leckar, and all other things belonging to dying. If
before you returne you could procure a single good
workeman in the arte of Turkish carpet making you
should bringe the arte into this Realme, and also
thereby increase worke to your company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hakluyt’s praise of the Persian carpets was not
undeserved, for their manufacture in his time had
reached a period of excellence as regards design and
workmanship which it has been from time to time the
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
aim of modern manufacturers to reproduce, as far as
the conditions and requirements of the present day
permit. Many of the best specimens in the museums
and collections of New York, London, Vienna, and
Paris are attributed to the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. When Hakluyt wrote there was in existence
a carpet at the Mosque of Ardebil, in North-West
Persia, which is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
The date of this carpet is 1540, and experts agree that
it belongs to the best period of Persian carpet weaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, unfortunately, no record whether the efforts
of Hakluyt and the merchant adventurers of his time
to obtain weavers from Turkey or Persia were successful.
Carpets do not find a place among the goods to be
especially sought after by their agents. As far back
as the reign of Henry VIII we read of Cardinal Wolsey
obtaining carpets through the Venetian Ambassador;
and in that reign Richard Sheldon lent his house to a
weaver named Richard Hicks, who produced among
other fabrics woven maps of Worcestershire and
Oxfordshire, specimens of which are still in existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In France, Henry IV gave assistance for the manufacture
of carpets, and in 1604 there was a strong guild
of carpet weavers; but it was not until the reign of
Louis XIV that the manufacture was revived at
Aubusson and established at Beauvais. The industry
had the direct patronage of the French King, and some
celebrated fabrics were made. The Revocation, in
1685, of the Edict of Nantes, which for a time had
given protection to the Protestants of France, drove a
large number of French and Walloon artisans into
England and Germany; and the spinning and weaving
were among the many industries in this country to be
benefited by this influx of skilful workers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1701 the carpet weavers of Wilton and Axminster
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
received a charter; but even at an earlier date the
manufacture of carpets had been carried on at these
places. Both these towns have given their names to
distinct fabrics that are now made in many places
and countries. Carpet manufacture is no longer carried
on at Axminster, where it flourished for about a century;
and other places, like Fulham, Moorfields, Exeter, and
Frome, where early attempts were made to establish
the industry, have long ceased to have any connection
with carpet making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the year 1740, the Earl of Pembroke brought
over weavers from France and introduced into Wilton
the making of loop-pile or Brussels carpeting. This
was followed in due course by the development of the
cut-pile fabric which took its name from the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the year 1736 the weaving of carpets seems to
have been established at Kidderminster, a town which
had been connected with the weaving of broadcloth
and “flowered stuff” from as far back as the reign of
Henry VIII. When the art was first introduced, what
is now called Scotch or Kidderminster carpet was made
on the old hand-loom; the process of weaving was slow
and laborious, and required a man and a boy to each
loom. In 1745, Mr. Broom started the manufacture of
Wilton and Brussels carpets in the town, bringing over
weavers from Tournai. In 1772 the number of carpet
looms in the town was 250, and the trade extended to
other places in the North of England and Scotland.
In 1830 there were nearly 1,100 looms in Kidderminster,
and a considerable home and foreign trade had been
established. A Parliamentary Paper of that date gave
the consumption of wool in the weaving of carpets as
one twenty-eighth of the whole quantity of wool
produced in the Kingdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1757, Mr. Thomas Moore started the manufacture
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
of carpets in London, and obtained a premium from
the Society of Arts for the best imitation of Turkey
carpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far back as 1778 there was a trade to some extent
at Kilmarnock. The original fabric was the two-ply
Scotch or Kidderminster carpet. In 1824, an engineer
of Kilmarnock introduced the three-ply Scotch carpet,
a fabric of three layers of different colours, each of
which is brought to the surface according to design;
while about the same time Brussels and Velvet pile
were also introduced into Scotland. In 1831, the
Trustees for Manufactures in Scotland awarded the
prize for four Turkey carpets, the first of that type
made in Scotland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last quarter of the eighteenth century the
inventions of Arkwright had been applied to the woollen
and worsted industries. Boulton and Watts had put
their steam engine on a practical footing, while Cartwright
had made a power-loom for the weaving of
calico, and had also patented a wool-combing machine.
In France, Jacquard was perfecting a device which,
when adapted to the carpet loom, was to play an
important part in the development of the industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the beginning of the nineteenth century,
progress, in spite of occasional checks due to general
economic conditions, was well maintained; and by the
year 1825 the Jacquard mechanism was beginning to
replace, both in England and Scotland, the old and
complicated harness of the hand-loom. A great increase
of trade followed its adoption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two other important inventions, which had a great
influence in extending the scope of the trade, were
developed in the thirties of the last century. The one
was the development of the tapestry process of printing
and weaving carpets by Mr. Whytock, of Edinburgh
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
and Glasgow. This process enabled a greater range
of colours to be used than was previously possible, and
also allowed a cheaper fabric to be produced. After
initial opposition, the process was developed in Scotland;
and finally, about the year 1842, Halifax became the
centre of the Tapestry weaving. Firms in other towns
were licensed, and the process was so widely taken up
that in 1850 there were 1,299 Tapestry hand-looms at
work in England and Scotland, as against 2,500 hand
Brussels looms. The other notable invention was that
of Mr. James Templeton, of Glasgow, who in 1839
patented a novel device for the manufacture of patent
Axminster carpets by a two-fold process. This also
admitted of a large range of shades. The invention
has since been considerably developed, and has contributed
largely to the extension of the carpet industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From small beginnings, early in the nineteenth century
the manufacture of carpets had grown in the course of
50 years to an important industry in the United States,
and was well established in Philadelphia and other
centres. Both in England and America the most able
inventors had turned their attention to the problem of
weaving by power. Mr. Collier, who had been successful
in weaving linen by power, produced, in conjunction with
Messrs. Crossley, of Halifax, a loom for the weaving of
Tapestry and Brussels. The problem had, however,
been solved by Mr. E. P. Bigelow, in America, and the
Bigelow patent was acquired by Messrs. Crossley. The
introduction of the power-loom created a great change
in the industry. The transition period from hand-weaving
to power-weaving was a period of anxiety to
manufacturers and of privation to the old hand-loom
weavers; but the situation was everywhere faced, and
from the first introduction of power-loom weaving ever-increasing
quantities of carpets have been woven, both
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
for home consumption and for export. In the seventies
of the last century another step forward was the remarkable
invention of the Moquette or Royal Axminster
loom by Alexander Smith &amp; Sons, of Yonkers, N.Y.
This loom was introduced to England by Messrs.
Tomkinson &amp; Adam, of Kidderminster; and the invention
has caused a still further extension of the carpet trade
both at home and abroad.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>MATERIALS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Carpet</span> manufacture is a complicated matter, and
involves the use both of various ingenious machines and
of a diversity of materials, such as wool, cotton, jute,
twine, oil, paper, wire, colours, size, etc. We need only
concern ourselves, however, with the more important
of these materials, which are yarns made of wool, in the
form of worsted or woollen, which are almost invariably
used for the surface of a carpet; and yarns made of other
fibres, which are used for warp and weft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wool used for carpet yarns is different from that
required for either cloth or hosiery. It need not be so
fine and soft, but it should be strong, and in the case
of worsted yarn, of fairly long staple, while natural
lustre adds to the value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A recent estimate of the sources of wool consumed by
the carpet trade allotted 9 per cent. to the British Empire,
as much as 40 per cent. to Russia, and the remainder to
other countries. Strong British wools, and the coarser
stapled fibres from Australia and New Zealand, form
the bulk of the first category, while Egyptian and East
Indian wools, which are in especial demand for woollen
yarns, are responsible for a large proportion of the last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of other materials that can be and are used for the
surface of carpets, mention should first be made of silk.
Hand-tufted carpets are sometimes made of silk both
in Asia and in Europe, and beautiful effects are obtained;
but the cost on the one hand, and the nature of the
yarn on the other militate against its being a very
suitable material for a floor covering. Carpets made
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>
with a silk pile possess a wonderful sheen, especially if
hand-woven, so that the tufts lie over at a considerable
angle; but the pile possesses no resilience and suffers
more from soiling in wear than a wool-pile carpet of a
corresponding quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mohair is used occasionally for hand-tufted carpets
with excellent effect, and it is often employed to great
advantage in self-coloured hearth rugs, for which there
is a regular demand. The extreme stiffness of the fibre
and its disinclination to felt, however, cause the yarn
to be a rather intractable material for carpet manufacture.
It possesses, moreover, the special characteristic
of considerable density. In other words, it is
heavy for its volume, so that a yarn of a given thickness
will weigh much more than a similar yarn of another
fibre, with the result that all mohair fabrics are expensive
compared with those made of wool or other yarns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jute is employed for the surface as well as for the rest
of the carpet at Dundee; and horse-hair Brussels carpets
are made, which are extremely durable, but somewhat
harsh, and not very decorative. Yarn spun from cow-hair
is utilised sometimes for the surface of carpets of
the Brussels or Dutch type, but perhaps more often for
filling warps; while cotton has been tried for the former
purpose also, but without very satisfactory results,
owing to the lack of resilience in its fibre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If to the cobbler there is nothing like leather, so to
the carpet manufacturer there is nothing like wool.
Yarn made of wool seems to be the ideal material for
the surface of a carpet. Wool is capable of being spun
easily into yarn of any required count or thickness; and
such yarn can be dyed to any shade, and woven into
any fabric. When woven, it will retain its appearance
and stand reasonably hard wear better than most
similar textile materials. Its liability to the attacks
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
of moths may be urged; but, after all, carpets are made
as much for use as for ornament, and it is well known
that the clothes moth only works when he is undisturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of subsidiary yarns, perhaps cotton is the most
important. This is used for a large proportion of the
chain warps of all kinds of carpeting. It is also occasionally
used for weft, and in its lowest qualities for
stuffers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flax yarn, more generally known in the trade as linen,
is used in considerable quantities, especially as chains
for Axminster, and as weft for Wilton and Brussels
carpets. Its combined strength and pliancy, coupled
with a certain degree of stiffness, make it a most useful
fibre. Jute and hemp, having regard to the total production
of all kinds of carpet, are probably used in
greater quantities than any other yarn. Jute is cheap
and strong, and is invaluable as a filling to give weight
and handle to a fabric. It has the disadvantage of
being liable to decay if it becomes wet, and in this state,
if used in too large a proportion, of causing the
disintegration of a carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of other materials that are sometimes used for the
backing of carpets, mention must be made of ramie,
which has been tried as a substitute for linen yarn,
which it resembles a good deal in character, being
strong and pliant, but inelastic. The cost, however,
has proved to be prohibitive. Various mixtures of jute
and wool, or of cotton and wool, have been tried, and
have their values as combining weight with resilience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paper yarn, though seldom as a matter of fact under
its own name, has been tried as a substitute for linen,
cotton, and jute, as weft, chain, and stuffer. It can
be spun or twisted into a presentable yarn in a variety
of counts; and a yarn that will weave and weave well.
During the war, owing to their shortage of other fibres,
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
the Germans used considerable quantities of paper yarn
for weaving cloths, webbing, harness, equipment, and
even carpets, which no doubt served their purposes
tolerably well. It was, however, a development pursued
rather from necessity than from choice. They
had plenty of wood, which we have not; and they
lacked the wool, cotton, and jute. Paper yarn cannot
seriously compete in price with jute, nor in value with
cotton, for use in carpets. It is, moreover, particularly
liable to deterioration from dampness.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>DYEING</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>All</span> worsted and woollen yarns used for the surface of
carpets, with the exception of those whereon the colours
are printed, as in Tapestry carpets, are dyed; and fast
and accurate dyeing is of cardinal importance in carpet
manufacture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Practically all worsted yarns, and some woollen yarns,
however, are supplied to carpet manufacturers by the
spinners in oil or in grease; that is to say, still impregnated
with the oil which has been put into them in the
process of spinning. The freeing of the yarn from this
oil by washing is a necessary preliminary to dyeing,
inasmuch as the presence of oil would prevent the dye
liquor permeating the wool fibres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scouring is effected by soap and hot water, generally
by machines of one type or another. The yarn in
skeins is sometimes thrown upon swifts, which revolve
over a vat of suds. The skeins are carried through
the liquor and well rinsed by the rotation of the swifts.
Another method employed is to pass the skeins, tied
together in a long chain, through vats in which they are
steeped in the suds, and through rollers which squeeze
them more or less dry. Or the skeins may travel
along a series of aprons, underneath a shower, between
rollers, or through bowls of suds. The precise method
adopted is not of great importance provided that the
scouring solution has full opportunity to operate upon
the wool fibres, so that the yarn is delivered ultimately
free of oil and of soap. For this reason, a final bath of
pure water is desirable.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
The solvents principally used are ammonia, alkali,
and an alkaline soap of some kind. Cotton-seed oil soap
is generally regarded as one of the most suitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scoured yarn is now ready for dyeing, and
passes, without being fully dried, to the sticks or frames
of the hand-vat or dyeing machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three main considerations to be kept in view in
the dyeing of worsted and woollen yarns for carpets
are levelness of colour, accuracy of matching, and fastness
of colour to light. The second and third are
matters which concern the skill of the head dyer and
the quality of the dyestuffs which he employs; the
first depends upon the handling of the yarn by the
operative in the hand vat or dyeing machine; and the
essential factor, apart from the proper temperature of
the dye-liquor, is motion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dyeing by hand, although superseded almost entirely
by machine-dyeing, is still employed in some cases,
particularly where only small quantities are required.
The dye-vat is of wood, and should be a well-made piece
of joinery to withstand the wear and tear incidental to
its use. Round the bottom on the inside is fitted a tube
of copper or some acid-resisting metal, perforated with
small holes, through which steam is passed to heat up
the water. The head dyer weighs out the dyestuffs
estimated to produce a shade a fraction below the
required shade, so as to admit of final adjustment after
testing. This, of course, applies equally to hand or
machine-dyeing. For hand vats, the skeins of scoured
yarn are hung on a set of poles, which, when filled, are
placed on brackets above the vat. When the dyestuff
has been put in, and the water brought to the required
temperature, a pair of workmen, each holding one end
of the poles, standing on each side, sets them on the edge
of the vat and lets the free ends of the skeins sink
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
down into the liquor. When all the poles are in place,
the operators start on the pole at one end, and, raising
each skein in turn, draw it over a few inches, so that the
part which has hitherto remained outside the liquor is
now immersed. When the skeins on one stick are
finished, that stick is pushed a little way along and the
next is treated similarly. When the whole set is done,
the operation is repeated. The essence of the treatment
is to keep the yarn moving. If the skeins were allowed
to remain in the same place, even after the first moving,
there would be “stick marks” at the point where the
skein rested on the pole, because the liquor would not
have had as much access to this place as to the rest of
the skeins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After an hour or so, or when sufficient time has been
allowed for the dyestuffs to permeate the yarn fibres,
the poles are lifted on to the brackets, and a skein is
taken out and submitted to the head dyer for matching.
The head dyer will compare it with his standard, and,
in the case of dyeing to match a cut-pile or tufted
fabric such as Wilton or Axminster, he will probably
make a tuft from a thread of the sample skein, so as
to compare the shade of the cut ends as well as of the
outside of the thread. He will then make the necessary
corrections or additions to the dye-bath if the exact
shade has not been reached, and the operation will be
continued until he is satisfied. The poles are then
finally lifted, removed from above the vat to a horse;
the yarn is then stripped from the poles and passed to
the hydro-extractor prior to going on to the stove or
drying machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of dyeing machines, of course, is to effect
the same treatment of the yarn as is done by hand as
just described, but in a more expeditious way. A machine
can, in fact, do nearly twice as much as a man, and in
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
a more regular manner. That is to say, one man can
mind a machine of the same capacity as a hand vat
which requires two men; but it is desirable, if not,
indeed, necessary, that he should have assistance in
loading and unloading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Given the necessity for keeping the yarn in motion
while immersed in the dye liquor, the problem of the
designer of dye machines has been to find the most
simple and effective way of doing this, keeping in view
the need for convenience in preparing the yarn for
the bath, dropping it in, and removing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dyeing machines are of two main types: those which
move the yarn through the liquor, and those which
move the liquor through the yarn. Each type has in
common a frame of some kind to carry the dye-sticks
on which the yarn is hung; and practically every type
of frame is provided with sticks to support the skeins
at one or both ends. Of the former and earlier type the
movement of the frame carrying the yarn in the liquor
may be effected in various ways. The frame in one
machine is revolved in the vat upon a circular axis;
in another the revolution is combined with a rocking
motion; in a third a vertical movement is obtained by
means of a hydraulic pump fitted with an automatic
reversing mechanism. In each case the problem of
moving the yarn in the liquor is complicated by the
minor problems of moving the yarn on the sticks so
as to avoid stick marks, and of raising and lowering the
frame, or of stripping it in position, if irremovable.
The former is solved by some worm or ratchet contrivance
for automatically turning the dye-sticks, and the
latter by cranes or tackle, or, as in one of the makes
just mentioned, by a hydraulic pump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the machines of this main type have their advantages
and disadvantages, as they have their supporters
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
and critics; but there can be little doubt that the balance
of opinion among carpet yarn dyers is growing preponderatingly
towards the second type of machine;
that in which the liquor is moved through the yarn.
In this type, the frame carrying the yarn is dropped
into the vat, which is then covered with a lid. The
liquor is then caused to circulate in a strong stream
throughout the vat by propellers fixed at the head.
The motion of the propellers can be reversed if desired.
If both top and bottom sticks are used in the frame,
they are placed at a less distance apart than the length
of the skein, so that, the skein being completely
immersed, the yarn is carried free of the stick by the
flow of the liquor, access is given to all the wool fibres,
and the danger of stick marks is avoided. The chief
merit of this machine, however, is the considerable
economy that is effected in steam consumption by the
reduced size of the vat, as well as by the lid. The vat
need only be made just large enough to contain the
skeins dropped into it, whereas in the other type of
machine it must be made large enough to allow for the
skeins to be moved about in it. There is, therefore,
less water to be heated for a given weight of yarn. The
lid avoids loss of heat by radiation, which is inevitable
with the open top types.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chemistry and the science of dyeing worsted and
woollen yarns is a subject that can only be dealt with
adequately at considerable length. Here a brief
reference must suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wool fibre is a substance similar in nature to horn,
with a scaly surface. It is hygroscopic, being capable
of taking up a large amount of water compared to its
own bulk, and when moistened and heated it tends to
soften and swell. These characteristics make wool very
susceptible of being dyed. It is said to have an affinity
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
for certain colouring matters, but this phrase serves to
cover a want of agreement among chemists, as to
whether dyeing is actually of a chemical or a mechanical
nature. It is probably both. In any case, wool is
easy to dye compared with silk, cotton, or other fibres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Natural dyestuffs, such as logwood, madder, fustic,
cochineal, and indigo, are practically obsolete so far
as dyeing for carpet yarns is concerned; and the modern
dyer has a large range of aniline and alizarine colours
to choose from. As is pretty generally known, the
production of dyestuff from coal tar was originally a
British invention, but its development passed into the
hands of the Germans, upon whom, before the war,
the dye consumers of the carpet trade, as of other trades,
were very largely dependent. Necessity and enterprise
have remedied this deplorable state of affairs, which
need never recur. The coal tar dyes now being produced
by British dye manufacturers are trustworthy and
satisfactory, and they should improve both in quality
and quantity as time goes on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the purposes of the carpet yarn dyer, at any rate,
the anilines and alizarines now obtainable are infinitely
preferable to any natural or vegetable dyes, being
easier to use, more reliable, and faster to light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ordinary method of preparing the dye-bath into
which the worsted or woollen yarn is to be dipped in the
manner that has been described, is as follows. The
water, in which from 2 to 4 per cent. of sulphuric acid
and from 5 to 10 per cent. of Glauber’s Salts is mixed, is
brought up to about 170°F.; the dyestuff is added,
about 1 to 5 per cent., according to the depth of shade
required. The percentages are reckoned upon the weight
of the yarn to be dyed. The yarn is then entered, and
the water is brought to the boil, and kept lightly boiling
as long as required to obtain the shade. There are
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>
some delicate shades, however, and some sensitive dyestuffs,
for which the yarn requires to be entered cool,
and the water to be brought slowly to the boil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dyed yarn passes from the vat to the hydro-extractor,
a large copper pan with perforated sides,
which, revolving at a great speed, causes the wet skeins
by centrifugal force to press against the circumference
and squeeze out a large proportion of the water they
contain. The skeins are then taken out, bundled
roughly together, and are ready for conveying to the
drying room or drying machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Drying the yarn can be effected simply by hanging
the skeins on poles in a room through which strong
currents of air are forced by revolving fans. This
method, however, depends too much upon the weather,
even if the air is caused to pass over steam-heated coils
on entering the room. A better alternative is to expose
the yarn hung on poles in a heated chamber. The
most certain and satisfactory method, however, is a
drying machine of some type, which enables the skeins
to be fed into it at one end, to pass through a current of
heated air, and to be delivered dry at the other. The
factors in this case, the heat of the steam coils and the
speed of the machine, are known and can be controlled;
so that the dyer can rely upon getting a certain quantity
of yarn satisfactorily dried in a certain time. In the
ordinary type of machine, the skeins are carried horizontally
between two wire aprons; but alternatively
they can be carried vertically upon hooks or poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yarn, coloured and dried, is now ready to go to
the yarn store, or direct to the winding-room.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HAND-MADE CARPETS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> characteristic feature of a carpet, as distinguished
from other floor coverings, is the combination of a
surface composed almost always of wool with a woven
foundation, which may be of various materials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main classification of carpets is between those
which are made by hand and those which are made by
machine; and of both these classes there are many
sub-divisions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand-made carpets are the oldest type of the fabric,
and, coming from the East, are the historical parents
of all modern carpets. This kind of carpet is made
to-day in the United Kingdom, on the Continent, and
in the East in almost exactly the same manner in which
it has been made by the Orientals for several hundred
years. The principle is extremely simple. The warp
threads, or chain, are wound on two horizontal beams,
between which they are stretched vertically. The
beams are carried by upright posts on which they can
revolve, the space between the posts determining the
width of the rug or carpet. The weavers sit side by
side in front, the carpet as it is woven being gradually
wound on to the lower beam, and the warp correspondingly
unwound from the upper beam. The yarn
for the pile is cut up into tufts about 2 in. in length, and
is knotted round two warp threads, tuft by tuft, according
to the paper design, which is attached in front of
the weaver. As each row, or part of a row is finished,
two weft threads are put in, one in the shed formed
between the front and back halves of the chain, and a
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
second in an alternate shed, which is formed by the
weaver pulling forward the back half of the chain
temporarily in front of the front half. The second weft
is put in straight, the first one loose, zig-zag, or vandyked,
so as to fill up the back of the carpet, and to avoid the
tendency towards lateral contraction. The weft is
beaten down into its place by a heavy fork or beater.
This interlocking of warp and weft with the tuft forms
the weave of the carpet, and has been imitated more
or less in all mechanically woven carpet fabrics.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='turk'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i028.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0002' style='width:30%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig.</span> 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TURKISH KNOT</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>There are two different kinds of knot employed, the
Ghiordes or Turkish, and the Senne or
Persian. In carpets made with the former,
the tuft of yarn is knotted round a pair
of warp threads in such a manner that the
two ends of yarn come between the two
warp threads round which the tuft is
looped, and consequently two pile ends
alternate with every two warp threads.
In Persian carpets the tuft is knotted
in such a way that one end of the tuft
obtrudes between each warp thread. This method
of weaving renders possible a closer texture than
the Turkish knot; while carpets of suitable design
and finer pitch are often woven with a running
thread looped round the finger of the weaver, and then
cut, instead of by individual tufts. This latter system
gives more waste but quicker weaving. With both
Turkish and Persian knots the tuft ends do not stand
up at right angles to the plane of the fabric, but lie over
obliquely towards the starting end of the carpet. This
natural slant of the pile, which results in presenting
to the eye and the foot of the user of the carpet partly
the ends and partly the sides of tufts, is a very characteristic
feature of hand-made carpets, and one which
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
cannot be completely imitated by any class of
machine-made fabrics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another kind of hand weaving is the tapestry method,
wherein the weft colours, wound upon wooden needles,
are threaded round and between the warp ends, leaving
a flat or slightly ribbed surface, not unlike that of an
ingrain carpet. The absence of a tufted pile does not
make this a luxurious carpet; but it enables a fine pitch
to be employed, and the richest and most delicate
effects of design and colour to be obtained. Carpets of
this type have long been made at Les Gobelins, Paris,
Aubusson, and Beauvais, in France, and Tournai, in
Belgium. The work is slow and highly skilled, and
the product is naturally very expensive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no better kind of carpet than the carpet
made by hand; though this is far from implying that all
hand-tufted carpets are superior to all machine-made
ones. But there is no method of combining the pile
with the foundation so good as the knot; and it cannot
be completely imitated by the cleverest power-loom
invented. The hand-tufted carpet possesses an individuality,
even in its faults, which no product of a
machine can attain, and which, after all, is an attribute
to a work of art. More of the soul of the worker has
passed into it than the clashing metal of a power loom
will permit to filter into its product.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hand-made carpets have a further advantage in
their adaptability to requirements. A single carpet,
for instance, can be made to any specified shape,
size, design, colour, and quality. It is possible to
produce in one piece carpets of oval, circular, or
L-shaped form, or to conform to irregular curves and
angles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Qualities are numerous, but may be said to vary
mainly between about 9 and 400 tufts to the square
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
inch. The average European hand-made carpet will
not run to more than from 16 to 30.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards materials, the tuft yarn will vary from a
heavy woollen for coarse pitches to a fine worsted for
the closer, while silk is occasionally employed, producing
a carpet of greater lustre, but less resiliency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eastern weavers are fond of using woollen of
suitable counts for both warp and weft, though a cotton
warp is quite common. Flax or linen, however, is more
commonly employed by the European maker; and the
combination of strength and softness in this material
seem to make it almost ideal for the purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>European hand-tufted carpets may be considered as
upon a different footing from Asiatic. Indeed, the
carpet dealer would hardly regard the two—at any rate
in pre-war days, would hardly <span class='it'>have</span> regarded them—as
mutually competitive. The main localities for this
branch of the industry are Maffersdorf, in Austria,
Holland, Donegal, Carlisle, and Wilton. But, although
in each of these places carpets of characteristic Eastern
design and colouring are produced, their staple trade
has always lain rather along the lines of specialities.
They have catered rather for architects, decorators,
individuals, or public bodies, who were inspired by
some particular idea, and who could afford to pay for
it, than for the ordinary consumer. To make standard
carpets for stock, unless it were some crimson Yapraks,
would be quite exceptional. The reason for this, and
the relation of European and Asiatic hand-made carpets
will be alluded to later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At any rate the fact remains, that the European
hand-tufted carpet trade, though it has been responsible
for some superb productions in a variety of styles—and
in this connection due credit must be given to the
enemy maker alluded to—yet it never attained a
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
position of importance adequate to its undoubted
merits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is quite impossible to deal effectively in a limited
space with so large a subject as that of Oriental carpets
and rugs. Books have been written on the historical
and artistic aspects alone. Some brief notes must
suffice. It is interesting to recall that the inhabitants
of Persia and Asia Minor, who were the earliest makers
of carpets, were nomads. They wove their tents,
decorated with tribal signs and symbols, and they
wove the curtains or kelims for greater comfort and
ornament. Rugs and carpets followed in natural
sequence. The primary object of these was to cover
the raised bank of earth at the end of the tent on
which the chief sat. Other rugs and mats were placed
round the tent for the use of the family or of visitors.
Besides these, there were the prayer rugs for their
special purpose, which were carefully stored when not
required for use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the dwelling-place developed from a tent to
a house, a raised seat of honour covered by a rug took
the place of the bank of earth; and divans on each side
of the room, for which long rugs or runners were required,
accommodated the family and callers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Weaving was, and still is, largely a family affair, in
the East. The women and girls sit in front of the
loom and work under the supervision of the matriarch.
Obviously the degrees of skill employed will vary; and
this leads to some of the irregularities in Eastern carpets,
which, however, are regarded rather as beauties than
as blemishes by the Western buyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not to be implied, however, that all Oriental
carpets are still the product of family or tribal industry.
Western methods have penetrated even into the
“unchanging East”: organisation of the industry
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>
has been set up; and carpet dealers and importers’
syndicates in New York, London, and Paris have their
agents in the East, and even control their own factories,
to which they send their orders. This may be thought
to detract from the romance of the Oriental carpet,
but it does not appear to have affected adversely the
progress of the industry or the merit of its products;
and there is no reason why it should, so long as the
Western buyers are men of taste and experience, and
do not seek to impose uncongenial ideas upon the
Eastern worker, which might tend to the destruction
of individuality and local feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a common fallacy, that the yarns of Oriental
carpets are dyed solely with vegetable dyes, and that
those dyes are intrinsically superior to aniline and
alizarine dyes, such as are employed for yarns for
machine-made fabrics. The latter have been used for
many years now by European carpet manufacturers,
not because they are cheaper than vegetable dyes, but
because they are easier to use, more accurate for
matching purposes, and faster to light. There are, of
course, good and bad synthetic dyes, but the best are
immeasurably superior to dyes made from plants, barks,
and berries. This fact has long been recognised by
those who control the production of Oriental carpets,
for the yarns for which aniline and alizarine dyes are
now extensively employed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of dyeing naturally leads on to that of
doctoring or “faking,” which is commonly adopted
with a large proportion of Eastern carpets. The object
is twofold: to soften the original brightness of the
colours, or to give an appearance of age; and to obtain
a gloss which the wool does not naturally possess.
This is generally done by the collectors or agents, and
not by the people who weave the carpets. It is often
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
known by the innocent name of <span class='it'>washing</span>, and consists
in treating the surface with some chemical such as
chlorine water, or glycerine, followed by ironing with
a hot iron. It can hardly be supposed that this treatment
does not detract to some extent from the life of
the carpet; but this consideration appears to be
outweighed by that of the more attractive appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been stated that it is not an uncommon practice
to expose a carpet to use in the bazaar or street
with the object of enhancing its commercial value by
giving it an artificial appearance of age. It is to be
hoped, however, that this very insanitary method of
faking is rare; but those who wilfully give preference
to a carpet because it is dirty and faded, and apparently
old, do not deserve too much sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are varieties of Asiatic carpets far too numerous
to be mentioned here. They differ widely in origin,
design, colour, and quality, each town or district having
its characteristic pattern and ornament, which is
followed with more or less persistence. The finest
carpets, both in pattern and quality, are the Persian,
the worst are some of the Indian, which are coarse in
texture and devoid of artistic merit. In between are
the standard Turkeys, which are in great and steady
demand all over Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reference has been made to the very different position
occupied by Asiatic and European, or at any rate
British hand-tufted carpets. Practically identical in
manufacture, they are in different categories commercially.
The Eastern carpet trade is a large one, healthy,
well organised, and profitable. The British hand-tufted
industry is artificial, and maintains a precarious
existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may not be considered quite outside the scope of
this chapter to examine the reason for this position.
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
The question is in reality purely an economic one.
British hand-tufted carpets cannot be manufactured
on a basis of cost that enables them to compete in
price with the imported Eastern carpet. The question
of design and colour may be ignored for the moment;
quality for quality, the domestic product cannot meet
its Oriental competitor on equal terms in the market,
despite the fact that it comes straight from the manufacturer,
while the other has probably had to bear
collectors’ and wholesale dealers’ profits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reason lies, of course, in the different standard
of living. The cost of the raw materials is not substantially
different in Great Britain and in Asia Minor.
But the British carpet has got to pay for steam-heating,
gas and water, and electric light, and a more liberal
standard of diet, than suffices the frugal Armenian or
Kurd. The women and girls who weave Eastern
carpets are not protected by factory inspectors and
welfare superintendents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the difference in cost of production due to these
very different conditions is very considerable; while in
view of the increase of wages during the war, and the
steadily advancing standard of comfort among British
artisans, it seems likely to be even more in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under these circumstances, it is justifiable to ask
whether it is fair and wise to allow this competition to
continue. During the war the import of Oriental
carpets has been prohibited, and it cannot be claimed
that the results have been disastrous. The stock of
Oriental carpets existing in the country when the
prohibition was initiated has changed hands at steadily
increasing prices. In other words, the people who
wanted the carpets keenly enough have got them,
and have had to pay handsomely for them. Why
should not this prohibition, or alternatively a high
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
import duty, be maintained? No one would suffer
except the Turk, about whose financial welfare we
need not perturb ourselves, and possibly the semi-European
middleman and agent. The <span class='it'>bona fide</span> dealer
in Oriental carpets, located in Great Britain, would be
able to convert his capital and his technical knowledge
towards the building up of a big British hand-tufted
industry; and in a few years we should see in private
houses, hotels, and clubs, instead of the Asiatic product,
for which our money has been sent out of the country,
real British hand-made carpets, which would have been
manufactured under ideal conditions, and for good
wages. And there is no reason in the world why such
carpets should not equal or surpass in quality and
artistic merit the finest productions of the East.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BRUSSELS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Of</span> machine-made carpets, that which naturally demands
the first mention is the Brussels carpet, which was the
first kind to be woven in this country by the aid of a
Jacquard, a pattern-selecting mechanism to which
allusion will be made later. Brussels is a loop-pile
fabric, consisting of a strong woven foundation, composed
of linen, jute, and cotton yarns, together with
that portion of the worsted yarn which is not utilised
on the surface to form the pattern. The pattern itself
is formed on the surface by differently coloured looped
threads of worsted yarns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of the fabric lends itself to patterns
well-defined in design and colour. The smooth, gently-ribbed
surface gives a clean and neat, but not a luxurious
effect; and the carpet is generally more suitable for
small and medium-sized rooms and simple furnishing
schemes, than for bold or ambitious effects. The number
of shades available is also limited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The processes of manufacture are comparatively few
and simple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yarn is received from the spinner in grease, that
is, still containing the oil that was put into the wool
for the purpose of spinning, and in skeins. Worsted
spinners supply a large variety of counts and twists
of yarn for Brussels and Wilton carpets, which need
not be particularised. As a normal Brussels yarn we
may take 16s, 2 × 3; a thread sharply twisted in the
doubling, and loosely in the re-doubling, running about
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
100 yards to the ounce. The yarn should be spun from
wool of a moderately long staple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the dye-house it is first scoured, to get rid of the
oil, which would interfere with the dyeing, and then
dyed. From the dye-vat the yarn is taken to the hydro-extractor,
or wince, where a large proportion of the
moisture is eliminated by centrifugal force. The skeins
of dyed yarn are then dried, either by being hung on
poles and exposed to a current of warm air, or by being
passed through a mechanical dryer, which normally
consists of a large chamber of wood and iron, through
which the yarn is carried by an apron, or pair of aprons,
while exposed to streams of hot air propelled by fans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the drying room or drying machine, the yarn
passes to the winding room, to be wound on to bobbins.
The winding frame consists of a series of pulleys set on
a shaft. Opposite each pulley or drum is a swift on
which the skein is adjusted, the end of the yarn from
the skein being led on to the body of the empty bobbin,
which is held against and rotated by the pulley, the
face of the pulley being a little less than the space
between the flanges of the bobbin. This bobbin, called
the creel bobbin, because it goes into the creel frames
of the loom, has a face of 2¾ in. and a flange diameter
of 3½ in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The creel bobbins, each of which when fully wound
will contain about 1/3 lb. of yarn, are then taken to the
creel frames at the back of the loom. For a best five-frame
Brussels carpet, five sets of 256 or 260 bobbins
will be required. These five sets are placed in each of
the five creel frames, each bobbin being free to revolve
slowly on a creel peg, and so release its yarn as required.
Each of the 1,280 or 1,300 ends of yarn is led through
to the front of the loom, being threaded first individually
through an eyelet in the harness, and then, along with
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
the other ends of yarn that belong with it, through a
reed of the sley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The body and back of the carpet is provided for
normally by two warp beams, the chain and the stuffer.
The chain consists of twice as many ends of cotton as
there are reeds in the sley. Thus, if the pitch is 256,
there will be 256 reeds, or reed spaces in the 27 in.
width of the sley (in practice the sley is made a little
wider than the carpet is to be woven); and there will be
512 ends of cotton chain in the same width, two to each
reed space. The stuffer beam consists normally of as
many ends as there are reed spaces. The stuffer warp
is of jute, bump, or cotton yarn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of the chain is to form, in combination
with the weft, the woven base of the fabric; all the rest
is either surface or back. The weave is effected by the
chain ends being threaded through eyelets mounted on
two heald-frames or gears, which rise alternately in
such a way as to allow the shuttle, carrying the weft,
to be shot through the shed or opening thus formed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The purpose of the stuffer, or dead warp, is merely
to give body or weight to the fabric, and it is not essential
if there is enough body provided by the rest of the warp.
The stuffer ends are also carried on eyelets in a gear
frame, but are not divided like the chain, and remain
practically in the middle of the fabric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both chain and stuffer beams lie between the creel
frames and the main part of the loom. Their slow
unwinding is operated automatically while the loom
is running.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The harness consists of a set of 1,300 cords, carrying
the mails or eyelets through which the worsted is
threaded, kept taut by a weight at their lower ends,
and connected with the Jacquard mechanism above.
The Jacquard (the invention of Joseph Marie Jacquard,
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
of Lyons) is an ingenious device for selecting and
raising the threads required to form the pattern. The
Jacquard principle in various forms is in use throughout
the textile trades, and need not be described in detail
here. The essential feature of it is the combination
of perforated paper or card with needles or pegs in such
a way that the blank (or, it may be, the perforation) in
the card causes the harness carrying a certain thread,
or set of threads, to rise as required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The operation of the Brussels loom may now be
described. The ends of worsted yarn from the creel
bobbins having been drawn through the eyes in the
harness, and the chain and stuffer ends through the
eyes in the healds, all are drawn through the sley in
such a way that there will be in each reed-space five
ends of worsted, two of cotton chain, and one of stuffer
warp. All ends are now made fast to the breast roller
at the front of the loom, and kept taut by weighting
the warp beams, and by hanging small hooked weights
on to each thread of worsted close to the bobbin in the
creel frame.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>When the loom is running, the Jacquard lifts one
worsted thread in each reed, thus forming a shed, under
which the wire is introduced from the side. Immediately
below the wire now lies the body of the fabric, consisting
of the four frames of worsted in each course, which are
not required to form the pattern, the stuffer warp, and
one half of the cotton chain. Below the body of the fabric
is a lower shed formed by the other half of the cotton
chain, and through this the shuttle passes, carrying
the weft, at the same time as the wire is being inserted.
Then the lathe, which has been lying back to allow the
passing of the shuttle and the entrance of the wire,
comes forward with the sley, and beats up the wire and
the last shot of weft against the breast-plate of the
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
loom and the last part of the woven fabric. At the same
time the Jacquard allows the harness carrying the ends
selected for the last lash to drop back on to a level with
the others, and the gears carrying the cotton chain
begin to change. Next, the lathe goes back again; one
half of the chain is brought up to form a shed, under
which and over the rest of the threads the shuttle passes
back, thus effectively tying in the worsted threads
which are looped over the wire. Meanwhile the last
wire of the set (of about 30) which has moved forward
as the fabric is woven, is drawn out by a hook, and
carried back for insertion under the next shed of
worsted. A number of wires is used so as to avoid the
risk of the loops being pulled flat by the weight on the
yarn or the strain of the harness or sley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chains and stuffers are generally coloured and sized,
the yarn being slowly wound from bobbins or cheeses on
a frame or stand, passing through a trough of coloured
starching material, over a steam-heated cylinder, or a
series of pipes, on to an iron flanged beam. The weft,
which is normally of linen yarn, is also generally coloured
and sized, and is used whilst still damp. The colouring
certainly adds to the appearance of the carpet, and the
sizing adds stiffness and handling, though, apart from
this, and from the fact that it is expected by the dealer,
it is doubtful whether it is of any advantage, except in
the cheaper grades, where less yarn is used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brussels and Wilton carpets are described as being
of five, four, or three frames, according to the number
of sets of creel bobbins carrying worsted warp threads.
Each frame will generally be composed of threads all
of one colour; but an enhanced colour effect is often
obtained by one or more of the frames being “planted.”
This means that worsted threads of two or more colours
are arranged side by side in the same frame in groups,
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
in accordance with the design. If, for instance, the
design contains a rose, for the petals of which a frame
of pink yarn is to be used, then the colourist or weaver,
by a judicious selection and arrangement of bobbins,
can add to the colour effect by shading the petals from
light to dark; or, again, a flower may be coloured blue
in one part of the design and gold in another. Skilfully
used, this device makes a three-frame look like a four,
or a five-frame like a six, but it must be used with
discretion and with due regard to the design, or
disfiguring and tell-tale stripes will ensue.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Best Brussels has been taken as an example in describing
the process of manufacture, but a good many other
qualities are, or at least have been, made. Best is
256 pitch, beaten up 9 to the inch, but extra qualities
are made up to 11 per inch, which gives an excellently
close and even surface. Finer than this in pitch or
beat-up it has not been found practicable to go. Lower
qualities are made in 236 and 214 pitch, and even down
to 180, with beat-ups running down to 6½ or 6 per inch,
and a framage of three or two. In the coarsest qualities,
however, there is always the tendency to “grin,” that is,
for the weft and body of the carpet to be exposed
between the loops of the pile, unless the coarseness is
compensated by the employment of a thicker pile yarn
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
or a higher wire. This is, in fact, the case with a class
of Brussels that has been manufactured extensively
by some makers in recent years, where the yarn is spun
from low wool or cow-hair, and is a good deal heavier
than the ordinary Brussels worsted counts. This fabric
is almost entirely confined to plains and stripes, though
occasionally two frames are used, and a simple pattern
effect produced. It is a good wearing carpet, and
suitable for offices and modest purses.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='threef'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is, however, that the demand for all qualities
of Brussels carpeting has fallen off steadily during the
past few years; and the reasons for this are strong
and would seem likely to be permanent. Brussels has
suffered from the competition of Axminster on the one
hand, and Tapestry on the other. Brussels is, unfortunately,
an uneconomic fabric in its manufacture,
inasmuch as, in a five-frame for instance, for every
length of worsted that appears on the surface, four
times as much is hidden in the body of the fabric, and,
except in so far as it acts as filling, is wasted. A
Tapestry carpet, as will be explained later, avoids this
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
waste, and can therefore be produced with an equally
good surface as Brussels, and at a lower cost. We
ignore for the moment the characteristic defect of
Tapestry carpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheaper Axminster, again, and to some extent
the cheaper Chenille Axminster as well, have largely
superseded Brussels, owing to the fact that they can
be sold at almost the same price, while offering a more
luxurious effect with their cut pile surface and their
larger range of colours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are some dealers, moreover, who aver that the
manufacturers of the cheaper qualities of Brussels have
themselves to blame for the decreased demand, because
these qualities were not satisfactory in wear, and in
particular were liable to “sprout.” Sprouting is the
tendency of the loops in the pile of a Brussels
carpet to be pulled out through such external
agencies as a chair leg, a boot nail, a rubber heel, or
the claw of a dog or cat; though, indeed, complaints
seem often to have been framed as if on the assumption
that sprouting was a natural property of the carpet
similar to that of its vegetable namesake. Still, the
maker has had to admit that cheaper qualities are more
liable to the disease than better ones, and perhaps his
best retort has been that he was long borne down in
price and pressed to make cheaper qualities, and that
those who demand them must not complain too much
if they do not get all they expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, when all is said, with all its limitations, a good
Brussels is an excellent carpet. It has a clean surface
which does not harbour dust, and if the same can also
be said of the Ingrain carpet, Brussels has the extra
resiliency afforded by the looped pile. If its colours
are few, they are enough to give thousands of effective
variations, suitable for almost any kind of design; and
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
the comparative closeness of its pitch makes its patterns
neat and adaptable. A well-made Brussels carpet will
wear many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reverting to the processes of manufacture, the roll
of carpet goes from the loom to the measuring table,
where it is measured by hand or machine before passing
to the finishing or “picking” room. Here it is first dried
by passing over a steam-heated cylinder, or, in some
places, by being looped over a series of rails in a warm
chamber. Then the back of the carpet is picked; that
is, the superfluous material, if any, is removed and
defects remedied. The roll is then passed through a
shearing machine, provided with a rapidly revolving
shaft set with spiral blades, where the surface is brushed
and very lightly shorn, to remove loose and projecting
fibres. The surface of the carpet then is inspected by
the pickers, who mend any faults left from the weaving.
Their work is supervised and checked by the passers.
At this stage, some manufacturers pass their Brussels
carpets, particularly the cheaper qualities, through a
pressing machine, in which heavy pressure on the
looped pile is exerted by rollers, the object being to
obtain better cover, and to prevent grinning. It is
questionable, however, whether the process is of any
real benefit to the carpet, as it tends to impair the
handle of the fabric and the resiliency of the pile.
The final stage in the finishing department is the
rolling and measuring, which is done mechanically,
after which the roll is ticketed, papered, and corded,
and passes on its journey to the packing room, carpet
room, or warehouse, as the case may be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A digression seems necessary here on the subject
of breadth carpets, Cairo or Chlidema squares. Originally,
carpeting was only made in body or filling 27 in.
wide, and border 22½ or 18 in. wide, and in rolls or
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
pieces of about 50 yards; and if a bordered carpet was
required, 15 ft. by 12 ft., the dealer would cut it up
from the pieces, using, say, four breadths of filling each
12 ft. long, and enough border, ½ yd. wide, to go all
round, with mitred joints at the corners. There were
several objections to this method, which is, of course,
still necessarily employed in bordered carpets of unusual
sizes. It involves a thick and awkward seam at the
mitres, where the border has to be cut and turned
under; it is wasteful, as odd-shaped bits of border are
bound to be left over; and it is inartistic, inasmuch as
the figures in the border never match perfectly at the
mitre. Lastly, in Wiltons and in some Axminsters, it
causes false shading, because, the pile naturally leaning a
little in one direction, and not being perfectly vertical,
the border will only tone perfectly with the body on
one side of the carpet. On the three other sides the
light will strike the pile at a different angle from that
at which it strikes the pile of the body, and give a
different effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1863, a carpet was manufactured at Kidderminster
for presentation to the late King Edward VII, then
Prince of Wales, on the occasion of his marriage. In
view of the natural desire to produce an article worthy of
the event and of the industry, it was recognised that
no trouble and expense should be spared; and a carpet
was designed and woven in such a way as to obviate the
defects enumerated above. The carpet was exhibited
publicly and aroused much admiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is curious, however, to note that it was not until
about twenty years later that the new principle began
to be generally adopted by carpet manufacturers. The
delay in utilising the idea was no doubt due to recognition
of the heavy expense involved in additional designing
and card stamping, and of the loss of production,
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
and also to the absence of any severe competition from
Oriental and other seamless carpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The device consisted simply in designing and stamping
not two but five parts of the whole carpet: the filling,
the border at each side including the corner piece, and
the border at top and bottom. When, as is almost
invariably the case, the width of the border is less than
27 in., the difference between the width and 27 in. is
stamped in body, so that, for example, an outside
breadth containing 18 in. of border and 9 in. of body
is woven in a 27 in. loom. This breadth, of course,
also contains at each end the corner piece, and 9 in.
of the end border. The inner breadths of the carpet
will have 18 in. of border at each end, and filling in
between, woven so as to match on to the filling and
border of the breadths on each side. If will be readily
seen that in this manner the different breadths of a
carpet can be woven consecutively on the same loom,
and that a harmonious effect as regards both design and
surface can be ensured. (See Figs. 5 and 5<span style='font-size:smaller'>A</span>.)</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='chlid'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i048.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0006' style='width:85%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig. 5 &amp; 5a</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CHLIDEMA SQUARE</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The system has one or two minor limitations. The
width of the carpet must be some multiple of 2 ft. 3 in.,
and the matching of the side borders with the corner
pieces can only be perfect at certain lengths. Again,
the line of the seam is not concealed by coinciding
with the inner edge of the border; and, finally, these
breadth squares are more troublesome and expensive
to make and handle at every stage than piece goods.
Indeed, manufacturers would be justified in charging a
larger difference of price between squares and pieces of
the same quality than many of them do.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
In spite of the expense and loss of production involved,
the device proved on the whole a real boon both to the
maker and consumer of carpets, and was sooner or later
adopted by practically all manufacturers employing
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
3-4 wide looms. It placed those who utilised it in a
better position to compete with Eastern carpets, and
it has thereby contributed in no small degree to the
artistic development of the carpet trade. Indeed, it
may almost be said to have saved the life of the narrow
loom, in view of the remarkable evolution and consequent
competition of the wide loom, to which further reference
will be made later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In recent years it has been turned to a notable development
in the art of carpet making; the production of
medallion breadth squares. This involves the exercise
of the greatest ingenuity and skill on the part of the
designer, heavy expense in respect of card-cutting, and
the greatest care in weaving and finishing. When
completed, a medallion square is a triumph of technique.
The number of sizes available is obviously limited; but
a carpet of each size is absolutely perfect in design,
matching everywhere, as well as if made laboriously by
hand, instead of being the product of machinery and
brains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming back once more to the final stages of finishing,
though the roll of carpeting, body, border, or stair, is
complete and ready for the market when it is rolled and
papered, this is not the case with the breadth square,
which has so far been treated in the same way. The
square, or series of squares, which are still in a continuous
roll, are cut up into their proper lengths,
matched, and sorted. They are then passed to the
sewing room, to be made up into complete carpets.
Hand sewing has been superseded in most factories
by mechanical sewing, by hand or electric power, for
which Messrs. Singer supply a very efficient machine.
In the larger power machine made by this house, the
breadths to be sewn together are clipped face to face
with flush edges, and stretched in the frame of the
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
machine in such a way that the moving part of the
mechanism runs along over the two edges and sews
them together. The ends of the carpet, top and bottom,
are then turned over and hemmed by hand or machine.
The carpet is then fastened to the floor, face downwards,
and the seams are damped and then pressed with a
heavy heated iron. If these operations have been
properly performed, and if the edges of the breadths are
good, the seams of the carpet will be barely visible.
The carpet is then finished, though some manufacturers
prefer to stretch their carpets by attaching them tightly
to a frame, and leaving them for some hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the sewing room the carpets pass to the stock
room or the packing room.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>WILTON</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Wilton</span> carpeting is similar in manufacture in many
respects to Brussels. The loom is practically the same
for both fabrics, convertible from one to the other
without much difficulty or expense. The preparation
of yarns for worsted pile, chain, stuffer, and weft is
substantially identical, while most of what has been
said with regard to weaving and finishing operations
applies no less to Brussels than to Wilton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The essential differences are two—a major and a
minor one. In the first place, the loops of worsted yarns
are cut, so that the character of the surface is velvety
instead of smooth and ribbed. This is effected by the
use of a narrow wire ending in a knife blade, which blade
stands outside the fabric when the wire is inserted, but
severs the loops of worsted when the wire is withdrawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second difference, which, however, does not apply
to all grades of Wilton carpet, is that for the sake of
holding down the pile more securely, there are three
shots of weft to each row of pile, instead of two. This
is effected by an adjustment of the gear and harness
motions, in such a way that the lash or shed of worsted
selected to form the pattern does not rise alternately
with the shed of the chain, but once in every three
picks of the shuttle or beats of the sley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cutting of the yarn, resulting as it does in exposing
to view the ends instead of the sides of the wool fibre,
gives a richer and softer surface effect both in appearance
and in feel, while the treble weft shot makes a
better weave and a firmer fabric. Generally also
Wilton carpeting is woven closer, with more rows to
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
the inch, than Brussels, which necessitates, incidentally,
the use of thinner wires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The standard best or Super Wilton carpet is 256
pitch, with a beat-up of 10 to the inch, woven with a
wire about 3/16 in. high; a linen weft is used, and a
stuffer of bump. Five frames of worsted are generally
employed. This is an excellent carpet for dining and
drawing rooms, theatres, show rooms, and restaurants,
and will wear well. Several better qualities are made,
however; and the fabric lends itself readily to fine and
luxurious effects. Wires are used occasionally as high
as 3/8 in. or more.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='wilt'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i052.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0007' style='width:85%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'>Fig. 6</span><br/>SECTION OF FIVE-FRAME WILTON<br/>A, Chain; B, Pile warp; C, Stuffer warp</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Depth of pile, however, is not the highest desideratum
in a Wilton carpet; and the most notable development
of recent years in the fabric has been in the direction of
a fine, closely woven fabric with no excessive wool
surface. These fine Wiltons are made 256 pitch, 12
or 13 shots per inch, and are generally 2-shot, with
chain, stuffer, and weft of cotton. Neither depth of
pile nor weight is aimed at, but fineness and smoothness
of surface and artistic effect; and their great popularity
in spite of the present high price seems to indicate
that they have justified themselves. At the present
time most manufacturers of Wilton produce a fine
Wilton quality of this nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
Among the better qualities of Wilton, mention must
be made of Saxonies, the name given to Wiltons woven
with a heavy, sharply twisted twofold Saxony worsted
yarn, which possesses exceptional wearing qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below Super Wilton come the medium qualities, made
in 236 pitch, 10 to the inch, in five, four, and three
frames; artistic and serviceable carpets suitable for
studies, bed-rooms, and what may be called general use;
while they are also in great demand for Cinema theatres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cheaper grades of Wilton are made in 214 pitch
with three frames or less. Their manufacture has been
limited during the war by the restricted supplies of
worsted yarn; and even before that time they suffered
from the competition of woollen Wiltons, of which
mention will be made. The limitation of colours on
the one hand, and the comparative poverty of the
fabric on the other, restricted the demand to those for
whom the question of price was important; and now
that price-cutting has passed away in an era of high
values and shortage of material, these qualities are
out of favour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Woollen Wiltons, or Wilton fabrics whose pile is made
of a sharply twisted woollen yarn, instead of worsted,
require special mention. They are of comparatively
recent growth, and probably originated in the effort of
the Jacquard loom manufacturer to meet the competition
of Imperial Axminster, dating from the time when
the price of the latter fabric was round about 4s., and
woollen yarn was correspondingly cheap. It was
necessarily rather an uphill fight for the Jacquard
loom, because the Axminster possessed the initial
advantages of a greatly superior range of colours, and
of greater economy in manufacture owing to the yarn
being all on the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The price of woollen Wiltons therefore had to be
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>
appreciably lower, and the qualities cut as much as
they would stand. Working on this basis, however,
the woollen Wiltons did justify their existence. Made
mainly in 214 pitch, with three frames of yarn or less,
and beaten up from 8½ to 7½ per inch, they achieved
unambitious but ingenious and saleable effects, and if
the cover and consequent wear was not all that could
have been desired, yet they served a purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it must not be implied that the only woollen
Wiltons were, or are, the cheap grades. The suitability
of woollen yarn for use in a Wilton loom to produce a
soft and even luxurious fabric with an Oriental effect
has long been recognised; and admirable qualities have
been woven in 256 and 236 pitch with four or five frames
of yarn and with fairly high wires. Indeed, some of these
can be regarded as more successfully imitating the
Eastern carpet in texture than even the finer worsted
Wiltons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilton carpeting lends itself particularly well to single
shade effects: plain Wiltons have been woven in a
variety of qualities with both worsted and woollen
yarn for many years; and, indeed, the demand has shown
signs of a steady increase. For those who are content
with a single colour on the floor in their scheme of
furnishing, and who do not object to the sensitiveness of
a plain carpet to “shading,” and, indeed, to the recording
of individual footprints, no fabric is better than a plain
Wilton. But it should be borne in mind that a plain
carpet has that defect. Wool fibre is elastic, but not
infinitely so. A plain carpet, however well and carefully
woven, cannot be expected to retain its virgin
smoothness and level colour for long under wear. Wear
on a carpet is never evenly distributed: the feet tread
down some places more than others; the pile is depressed
unequally, with the result that, in a plain carpet, the
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>
light, falling at different angles upon the fibres causes
light and dark patches to appear. This is called
shading, and is often wrongly attributed to defective
manufacture, or to the presence of some foreign substance
like oil. Shading actually occurs equally in
figured Wiltons; but it is rarely the subject of complaint,
simply because it is concealed by the design and colours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subject to this limitation, then, plain carpets, and
plain Wiltons in particular, are all right for those who
like them. The manufacturer does not regard them
with great enthusiasm, for, though in some respects
they are easier to make than figured goods, yet they are
exacting if they are to be turned out perfectly. Moreover,
they are more subject to competition, and do not
afford scope for artistic skill in design and colour
combination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As has been indicated, Wilton carpeting, like Brussels,
has, in comparison with some of its competitors, two
main limitations; one economic and one artistic. For
every square or tuft of yarn showing on the surface,
there are, roughly, from two to four parts uneconomically
used in the body of the fabric, and the number of shades
that can be used to work one over the other to form
the pattern is limited to five, or, exceptionally, to six.
These limitations, however, are not serious ones; and
the Wilton carpet, in its higher grades, is regarded by
many as the best of all machine-made carpets. It is
certainly the finest; and closeness of texture, broadly
speaking, means both finer effects and better wear.
The higher grades of Wilton are made, as has been
stated, in pitch and beat-up which give from 95 to
123 points to the square inch; so that in the matter
both of texture and of delicacy of design, effects can be
produced in Wilton which surpass those of any other
carpet fabric, with the exception of the finest Persians.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AXMINSTER</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Axminster</span> carpets, though in point of time a comparatively
recent development of the industry, may
claim to be, in point of structure, the nearest related of
all machine-made fabrics to the Oriental ancestor.
The similarity lies in the fact that they are tufted;
and the tuft, though inserted in the fabric mechanically,
and bound down without being knotted, undoubtedly
represents the knotted tuft of the original hand-made
carpet. The essential feature of a tufted Axminster
carpet is that the tufts are inserted row by row between
the warp threads, either before or after being cut off,
and are then bound down by the weft, and so woven
into the ground of the texture. Each tuft is used on
the surface, and forms part of the design; none of the
tuft material is hidden away or wasted in the body of
the fabric beyond what is needed for attachment to
the binding weft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Axminster loom was introduced into England
from the United States about 1878; and since that time
the fabric has developed steadily, with an increasing
popularity, which has only been rivalled in recent years
by that of the Chenille Axminster. Bradbury, in
commenting upon the similarity of Axminster in structure
and appearance to the original hand-made carpet,
says: “Generally speaking they are far superior to
Eastern and hand-made productions, and where price
is permitted to enter as a factor, they leave these
primitive structures still further in the rear.” This
may appear to some an extravagant appreciation; but
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
there can be no difference of opinion as regards the
general merits of the fabric. It combines economy in
the use of material, and in manufacture, with richness
of texture and almost unlimited potentialities of design
and colour effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As in other carpet fabrics, there are in Axminster
plenty of varieties of qualities; but there are comparatively
few differences in structure, such differences as
exist being mainly matters of pitch, tuft, or method of
tufting and binding. The original Axminster quality
was called the Royal. This is about 5 per inch in the
pitch, and 6 in the beat-up, with a tuft of about 7/8 in.
This held the field until 1893, when a strong invasion of
the British market by American Axminster, offered at
a considerably lower price, caused the Axminster makers
of this country to bestir themselves to meet this competition.
They did so strenuously; and the result was
the production of the quality known as the Imperial
Axminster, which had an instant and a lasting success.
This was made in a pitch of 7 to the inch, and a beat-up
of about 6½, and was put on the market at a moderate
price. For many years it held the position of being
the critical quality of the whole trade; the standard by
which the value of other qualities was measured, and,
as has been intimated, it is only of recent years that
its position has been challenged by the Chenille
Axminster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the present time, it would probably be safe to
estimate that three-quarters of Axminster manufacturers’
looms are being run on this quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Imperial Axminster quality may, therefore, be
taken as typical of the fabric; and a description of how it
is made will cover most of the ground, while variations
from the standard type can be indicated. The quality
itself is made in slightly different ways by different
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
makers, but a normal standard will have the usual
double chain, preferably of 2-14 or other linen, but
sometimes of cotton, a cotton stuffer, one end to each
reed, and a jute weft of about 2 fold 7½ lb. count.
The pitch is 189 or 190 in the 3-4 width. Fig. 7 gives
a transverse section through the weft of the weave
ordinarily employed. In this there are three warps employed,
the two chain warps being wound on one beam,
and the stuffer warp, which runs straight in the fabric,
on another. There are three double shots of weft to
each row of tufts. The two halves of the chain warp
alternately bind two double shots above, the tuft
binding shot and the intermediate, and one below.
The effect of this structure is to form a flat back, and
also, through the lateral pressure of the intermediate
weft upon the tuft weft, under the same warp shed,
to give the tuft a distinct inclination out of the vertical,
adding thereby to the fabric a point of similarity to
the hand-tufted carpet.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The diagram of another method of weaving this
quality is given in Fig. 8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three warps are used here again, but as each undergoes
a different rate of consumption, they are wound
upon three separate beams. The stuffer, as before,
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
runs straight; one chain binds the bottom and the
intermediate shots, and the other the tuft shot. In
this case, the tuft, equally supported on each side, tends
to remain vertical, while the bottom weft, projecting
below the tuft weft, gives the back a ribbed appearance.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='axm1'></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Each of these two weaves has its merits. The former
gives better cover with its sloping tuft, while the latter
claims an increased resiliency and immunity from the
shading in made-up carpets, so noticeable with the
first-named weave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fig. 9 gives other but less usual structures. It may
be noted that it is possible to employ jute for the
tuft binding and intermediate weft shots, and at
the same time a different yarn, preferably of woollen,
for the bottom weft, which shows on the back. This
serves to make the carpet heavier and more elastic to
the tread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Axminster may to some extent be compared with
Tapestry and Chenille, in that it is essentially a two-process
fabric; and the pile yarns are arranged so as to
form the design before they are put into the loom.
The actual method of preparation of the colours is,
however, quite different from that employed in either
of the other two fabrics.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
The yarn is received from the dye-house in skeins,
and is wound on to large bobbins with a 6 in. face.
The yarn from these bobbins has then to be wound
on to a series of wide spools, the number of which will
be the number of the rows of tufts in one complete repeat
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
of the design to be woven, while each spool contains as
many ends of yarn as there are squares in the width
of the design. This operation is called setting, or
sometimes, reeding-in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 6 in. bobbins, in number equal to the pitch of the
carpet, say, 189 or 190 for the 3-4 width of the typical
quality mentioned above, are arranged on a creel frame
fitted with horizontal pegs in order corresponding with
the colours of the first row of the design. Alternatively,
a horizontal frame or table is employed, fitted with
vertical pegs for the bobbins. This has the advantage
of being more compact and accessible, but the colours
are not so easily distinguished. The ends of the yarn
from each bobbin are led on to the wide spool, through
an open sley, which is opposite to it and equal in width.
These ends, suitably tensioned, are then wound on to
the wide spool. For a design of average length of repeat,
say 1 yd., one full spool will weave about 250 yds. When
the spool is full, therefore, the yarns are cut, and
fastened down; and as many more spools are filled with
the same arrangement of colours as are needed to weave
the required quantity. The operators then re-arrange
the bobbins in the creel frame in accordance with the
second row of the design paper, which is set up in some
convenient place for reference, draw them in order
through the sley on to the spool, wind a second set of
spools, and so on; each spool being numbered with its
rotation as soon as filled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the spools for the whole of the repeat are
wound, whether one or more for each row of tufts, they
are passed to women, whose task it is to thread the ends
through a series of tin tubes, the number of which
corresponds with the number of ends on each spool.
The tubes are soldered to a piece of tin, of L-shaped
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
section, which is attached to the tufting carriage. The
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>
spools with tubes attached are then placed in the
carriages, and are ready to be set up in order in the
loom for weaving.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The tufting carriages are then placed, in the correct
rotation so as to form the pattern, upon a pair of endless
chains, which are actuated by the driving mechanism
of the loom in such a way as to have an intermittent
motion so that, when each spool is in position to make
its row of tufts, the chains remain at rest long enough
for the spool to be removed from them, lowered for the
tubes to enter the warp threads; for the tufts to be
cut off, and the spool to be replaced on the chains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Each spool with its set of tubes and carriage, therefore,
is so set in the chains that it can be automatically
detached at the right moment and brought into position
to form its successive line of fur. The mechanism that
effects these ingenious movements is too complicated
to describe here. It is an object lesson as to what
variable and intermittent motions can be produced by
combinations of cams, bowls, levers, rods, etc., while
it gives the Axminster loom the distinction of being
probably the most ingenious of all carpet looms, subject
perhaps to that remarkable piece of mechanism, the
Jacquard, not being regarded as exclusively part of
a carpet loom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the spool reaches the lowest point in the path
of the double chain which carries it, a few inches above
the fell of the cloth, it is nipped by an arm from each
side, and conveyed downwards in such a way that the
tubes with the ends of the tuft yarns projecting are
made to enter the spaces between the upper shed of
the chain warp with a slight sweeping movement from
the front to the back. This has the result of trailing
the ends of the yarn close to the fell of the cloth and the
last row of tufts, and leaving a space below the upper
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
shed of the chain, so that the weft-carrying needle is
able to insert a double shot above the middle of the
exposed lengths of tuft yarn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tufting tubes are now lifted out of the shed, and
somewhat forward towards the fell of the carpet, so as
to double the tuft round the binding shot. At the
same time the sley comes forward, presses against the
tuft yarns and the weft enclosed by them, and carries
them up to the breast comb and the fell of the carpet.
With the tuft yarns and the spool in position, another
shot of weft is inserted, either with or without a change
of the warp shed, as the case may be, to assist in holding
fast the row of tufts in the carpet. The tufting carriage
and tubes are then lifted high enough to draw off a
sufficient length of yarn to form the next row of tufts
in the following repeat. The tufts are then cut by the
meeting of two broad knives, which come together at
the level of the surface of the carpet with a scissor-cutting
motion. The spool and carriage are then replaced in the
chains, moved one step forward; and the succeeding
spool is brought into position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may be desirable to mention a different method of
inserting the tuft yarn. In this case the spool is
detached from the chain and made to descend almost
straight, turning about 60° out of the vertical towards
the back of the loom just as the tubes enter the warp
shed. This has the effect of turning the free ends of
the tufts somewhat upwards. The spool is then turned
again so that the tubes are vertical, and are brought
close against the fell of the cloth. The binding weft is
then inserted, and the sley comes forward to carry the
tufts up against the breast. At this stage, a toothed
comb, made in two parts, one working over the other,
comes up from below the breast to turn upwards the
loose ends of the pile through the warp, one part of the
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
double comb, called the dummy comb, slipping over the
other so as to clear any tufts which might be pulled
down on to the back. Then the second binding weft is
put in, behind the tufts; and at the same time the tufts
are cut. There is another beat-up of the sley, and the
bottom weft is inserted. This completes the cycle; the
warp chains change; and the process is repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An alternative fashion of cutting to the double
scissor or guillotine knives is sometimes employed, a
circular knife in front engaging against a fixed straight
knife at the back. This system has the advantage
that the knives have not to be kept sharp, though
they must be very accurately adjusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weft motion is another ingenious piece of
mechanism. The weft is inserted in the warp shed
by a needle about 5/8 in. in diameter, entering from the
right-hand side of the loom. The jute weft is conveyed
from a ball, tensioned by suitable springs, and threaded
through the eye of the needle. It is obvious that the
weft shot must be double, and also that it would not
stay in the shed after the withdrawal of the needle,
unless it were caught in some way at the left hand of
the loom. This is effected by a small shuttle carrying
the edge-thread. This shuttle is similar to a sewing
machine shuttle, but larger, being about 3 in. long and
1 in. in diameter. It runs backwards and forwards in
a semicircular shuttle-race, and is so adjusted that it
passes under a notch near the end of the needle, and
over a loop of the weft, carrying the edge-thread through
the loop, and holding it taut while the needle is receding
in such a way as to prevent the weft slipping back, and
to make a good selvedge to the carpet. When it is
desired to use two different weft threads, the needle
has an open eye, or hook near its end, instead of the
ordinary eye, and the two wefts in turn are presented
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
to this eye by a rocking eyeletted weft-carrier, so that
the needle picks up the weft just before it enters the shed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There have been other developments of the Axminster
principle of inserting tufts into the weave of the fabric,
and variations from the method of the wide spool and
tubes. Of these, the most successful has been based
upon the idea of conveying the cut tufts by means of
nippers or grippers into the fell of the cloth. This has
been worked in combination with the wide spools, but
more satisfactorily in combination with yarn carriers
operated by a Jacquard with a differential lift mechanism
for selecting the colours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this loom, which has been brought to perfection
for various qualities, pitches, and widths, in recent years,
the pile yarns are wound on to creel bobbins, which
are arranged, in much the same way as in Brussels
and Wilton, in creel frames behind the loom. A frame
of bobbins is a set of bobbins of the same shade, equal
in number to the pitch of the loom. The number of
frames is limited in practice to about 16, which, however,
aided by “planting,” admit of design and colour effects
comparable with those obtainable in Royal Axminster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yarns are led between guide bars and through
perforated plates into the carriers, which are vertical
strips of steel or brass grooved back and front and
drilled with a series of slots, through which the ends of
the yarn pass, being held in position by small springs.
The frames of yarn are threaded through the holes in
the carriers in order, so that the yarns of the top frame
pass through the highest hole in the carrier, the second
frame through the second hole, and so on. Viewed from
in front, the ends of each frame of yarn will be seen in
horizontal lines one above the other in the front grooves
of the carriers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These carriers are connected by cords or wires with a
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
differential lift mechanism, which is actuated by the
Jacquard, in such a way that the blank or perforation
on the Jacquard card, corresponding with a certain
colour, causes the carrier to be lifted until that colour
is at the required height.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It can readily be understood that cards perforated
in different ways, and presented to the Jacquard at
once, can cause the carriers all across the loom to be
lifted varying heights in such a way as to show at the
required level a horizontal row of thread ends, corresponding
to a row across the width of the paper design.
The sequence of these rows, of course, forms the
pattern.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It remains to cut off the tufts, to lay them in their
place at the fell of the cloth, and weave them into the
carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a set of grippers, in shape very similar to the
neck and beak of a bird, mounted on three shafts, and
arranged so as to revolve in about a semicircle between
the carriers and the fell of the carpet. The Jacquard,
having operated so as to present the ends of the required
colour in the carriers in a horizontal line, the grippers
come up in front of them with open beaks, which are
inserted just into the carrier grooves, and then close,
nipping the ends of the yarn. The whole of the frame
in which the carriers are mounted is then withdrawn
away from the points of the grippers a sufficient distance
to give the required length of tuft. A flat-toothed comb
of hardened steel, of the same pitch as the grippers,
carriers, and carpet, drops down with its points between
the threads so as to hold them steady, while a travelling
knife or set of knives, passing along the face of the
comb, severs the tufts. The grippers then descend into
the warp threads, laying the tufts against the fell of
the carpet; the needle or shuttle passes over them and
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
through the shed, carrying the binding weft, which is
beaten up by the open sley, at the same time as the
grippers open to release the end of the tuft, and double
it upwards. Two other shots are inserted, while the
grippers move in their semicircular path upwards to
seize the next row of tufts, and again downwards to
lay them in place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The advantages claimed for this very ingenious
method of Axminster weaving are: that the preparatory
processes are considerably simpler than with the Royal
and Crompton patents; that the quantity of any pattern
to be woven can be better controlled; and that it involves
less waste. There is no disadvantage in the weaving
of a small quantity, if required, as 1 yard or 500 can be
woven equally well; and the yarn left over at the end
of an order can be cut off at the back of the carriers
with a minimum of waste, and stored conveniently on
creel bobbins. The cutting mechanism is also so good,
that the surface waste is reduced to a negligible quantity,
and a minimum of shearing and finishing is required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However this may be, it is noteworthy that the
principle has been applied with complete success to
looms for weaving wide seamless carpets, where the
gripper mechanism, though necessarily heavy, has
probably a distinct advantage over the wide spool and
tubes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Axminster, like other carpet fabrics, has tended to
develop in the direction of wide seamless goods; and
this is a tendency that will be worth watching, leading
as it does towards the evolution of the ideal carpet—a
machine-made knotted fabric. Ideal, that is to say,
in the sense that the knotting of a tuft on to a groundwork
of warp and weft is the best way of putting a
carpet together, and having regard for the facts that
we live in a mechanical age; that we cannot afford time
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
or money to make our own carpets by hand; and that
we ought not to buy foreign hand-made carpets. Experiments
in mechanically knotted carpets have continually
been made, and definite progress has been won in
recent years; but the technical difficulties are considerable,
and it will be interesting to see whether a
carpet of so exceptional a weave can be put on the
market, except at a price comparable only with that
of a hand-tufted fabric. Meanwhile, the seamless tufted
Axminster, as it is now made in two or three forms,
with tufts as securely fastened for all practical purposes
into the body of the fabric as if they were knotted, holds
the field as the nearest approach to the ideal, and is
deserving of a far larger measure of support from the
British consumer that it has enjoyed hitherto.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CHENILLE</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Chenille</span> Axminster carpeting possesses one or two
features which differentiate it sharply from other kinds
of carpet. It is the product of two distinct processes:
the formation of the chenille fur, and the weaving of
that fur, which is the weft, into a carpet. It is, in fact,
about the only cut-pile carpet fabric in which the
pattern is distinctively formed by the weft; for in
almost all other makes the weft only performs the
function of combining with the chain to form the
woven fabric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking first the manufacture of the fur, the dyed yarn,
which is normally a single woollen, about 55 yards per
ounce, is wound on cops which fit inside the shuttles
for the weft looms. Before starting to weave, the
weaver will have a supply of cops of all the colours
required in the carpet. The paper design will show
full size, the whole of the pattern, filling and border,
that repeats, in the colours that are to be used. The
design is cut up horizontally into strips two squares
wide; and the weaver works by this paper strip, which
is attached to the fabric in its length, inserting and
changing the shuttles carrying yarn of various colours.
The warp of the loom consists of sets of ends of fine
cotton at intervals of about ½ in. Thus the woven
fabric consists of a woollen weft of various colours held
together at intervals by a fine cotton warp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pitch of the warp varies, of course, according to
the character and quality of the fur to be made, the
scales, indicating the number of sets of warp threads to
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
the yard, being, normally, either 28, 38, 56, 76, or 112.
On an ordinary weft loom, making a fabric 42 in. wide,
on a 76 scale, there will be 88 strips, which will make
two repeats of a certain portion, say 4½ in. long, of 44
carpets. The average length of the woven strip is
about 48 yards.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig. 11</span></span><br/>CHENILLE DESIGN PAPER CUT UP</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The weaver has to insert by hand the shuttle carrying
the required colour to match the square or squares on
the painted strip of design paper, count the number of
shots needed, stop the loom, change the shuttle and
re-start the loom; so that it will be seen that quickness
of eye and dexterity are required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mechanical device has been invented for changing
the shuttles; but it is not automatic, and does not
appear to present any distinct advantage over the
method of changing by hand; and it can only be
employed with a limited number of colours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fabric is beaten up from 12 to 20 shots per
inch, according to the quality of the fur required; but
the closer beats up are only suitable for worsted yarn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next process is the fur-cutting. The roll of cloth
with its horizontal stripes is taken to the cutting machine,
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
where it is cut into strips by a series of knives set upon
a revolving cylinder, and spaced so that they sever
the woollen weft-threads as the fabric passes over the
cutting bed, and leave the independent strips of fur held
together by the fine cotton warp.</p>

formed with a series of V-shaped grooves. This has
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
the result of folding upwards the cut ends of the woollen
yarn, and giving a permanent V-shape in section to the
fur. The object of this is that when the fur comes to be
woven, its pile shall all be turned in one direction.
The damping of the fur just before the grooved cylinder
is sometimes effected by rollers revolving in a trough
filled with water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newly formed fur is then reeled off into individual
skeins. It is marked both with its pattern number and
series number, and sorted into its proper sets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a carpet 9 ft. wide beaten up 4 shots per inch,
it will be seen that each inch in the length of the carpet
will require no less than 12 yards of fur weft, so that a
strip of fur 48 yards long will only weave 4 inches; and
if the repeat of a design be a yard long, 9 series of fur
strips will be needed. The fur strips are, therefore,
sorted into their sets and numbered from 1 to 9 for a
1 yard repeat, or as the case may be; and are stored in
bundles of skeins until required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now come to the second part of Chenille manufacture,
the weaving up of the fur into the carpet.
This is done on a setting loom, which may be regarded
for the present purpose as normally of a width of 9 ft.
or upwards. This is not saying that Chenille is not
woven in narrower widths, for Chenille is woven in
pieces 27 in. and 36 in. wide, and a very large business
is done in rugs of various widths between about the
same limits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a carpet is ordered, the fur in bundles of
skeins is handed out to the cop-winder, whose duty it
is to wind the skeins on to cops for use in the setting
loom, and to serve them to the weavers in their proper
order. Cops are always the same size, but the length
of carpet that a cop will weave depends, of course, on
the width of the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
The setting loom is prepared for work by the threading
of ends of warp from various beams through eyelets
carried on gear frames, in much the same way as in a
Brussels or Wilton loom. Indeed, this principle is
common to all woven fabrics, varying only in its application,
that is to say, in the number and arrangement of
the warp beams, the yarn employed, and the pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a typical Chenille carpet, such as that which is
beaten up 4 to the inch, as above mentioned, the pitch
of the design will be 12 or 13 per inch (the beat-up of
the weft), and of the sley 7, though, indeed, the latter
is arbitrary, and need bear no relation to the fur.
There will be three warp beams, the catcher beam, the
chain beam, and the stuffer beam. A fourth is often
added, called the float. The catcher warp consists of
fine cotton, coloured in some neutral shade, so as to
be as nearly invisible as possible, its function being
merely to hold down the fur weft when it is inserted
into the fabric. The chain, or ground warp, which is
generally of jute yarn, is double, and is threaded on to
two gears, which rise and fall alternately as in Brussels.
The stuffer or dead warp, also of jute, runs straight
into the fabric, and gives it substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
For a 3½ or 4 per inch Chenille carpet, of average
quality, two shuttles will be used, one carrying the
jute binding weft, and the other the fur. There are
four picks of jute weft to one of fur, and at the end of
the fifth pick the loom stops automatically with the
chain and stuffer horizontal, and the catcher warp
forming a shed, under which the fur has just been carried.
The weavers, two to each wide loom, will then set the
fur, taking care that it matches correctly against the
last fur shot, and that the pile points upwards. They
will also lightly comb up the fur, so that it beds against
the last shot, and the catcher threads settle down
neatly through the pile. This done, the loom is
re-started: the first beat of the sley pushes the fur
shot home, and the next four jute shots are put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For closer weaves than 4 per inch, two jute weft
shots may suffice, while heavy woollen-backed carpets
are produced by the employment of a shuttle carrying
a woollen weft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of heavy-backed carpets, the double shed
is usually employed, the adjoining chain ends rising
alternately, so that they show on the back in diagonal
lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of a float warp, which rises a little above
the level of the stuffer warp just when the fur shot is
being woven, is to support the fur shot, and give a
fuller and more level effect to the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is another method of inserting the weft adopted
in looms of a different make, whereby it is carried
between the catcher and the other gears by a travelling
arm, which leads the fur from a basket or can in which
it is placed loose. This has the advantage of enabling
a long length of fur to be woven, while it also avoids
the crushing of the fur which results from its being
wound on to a cop. With this method the catcher
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
beam is placed high up in the middle of the loom, and
the sley is made of stronger reeds, open at the top to
allow the catcher warp ends to descend between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the loom the complete carpet passes to the
finishing room, where it is picked back and front,
brushed, steamed, combed, and shorn; all these processes
tending to fill out and level the surface. It is then
passed or examined for any defects that may have
escaped notice in the first mending. The ends of the
carpet, which are woven without fur, are turned over
and hemmed, preferably by machine. The carpet is
then subjected to a final scrutiny before being swept,
rolled, and dispatched to the packing room or warehouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As has been intimated, considerable variety of quality
can be obtained in Chenille Axminster by altering the
pitch and thickness of the fur in the weft loom, or the
beat-up in the setting loom. In practice, however,
competition has centred mainly round two standards
of quality: one about 12 shots of yarn per inch in the
fur, by 3½ or 4 per inch beat-up in the setting loom;
and the other about 14 in the fur and 5 in the setting
loom. Extra qualities, however, are also largely made,
and heavy fabrics which give an excellent imitation of
some Oriental carpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chenille carpets have increased enormously in popularity
during the past few years; and the cheaper
quality may be considered to have challenged even
Imperial Axminster in the consumer’s favour, and
almost to have become the critical fabric of the industry.
The reason for this is not far to seek. The taste of
carpet users all over the world has tended in recent
times more and more in the direction of seamless carpets;
while the demand for piece goods, in body and border,
has correspondingly declined. The evolution of the
Chlidema square, woven in 27 in. breadths with a
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>
border matching all round, has been to some extent
the cause of the loss of the piece goods trade; and it
succeeded in retaining the business, though in smaller
bulk, for the 3-4 yd. looms, both in Brussels and Wilton,
and later, in a less degree, for tufted Axminster. But
the breadth square has had to give way before the
seamless square, and in particular before the seamless
Chenille Axminster square. The cheap Chenille fabric
possesses several marked advantages over Brussels and
Wilton, Tapestry, and even over, tufted Axminster
breadth squares. It is without seam; it gives a comparatively
luxurious surface with the absolute minimum
of wool; and it is practically unlimited in colour. Further,
the looms are not expensive to erect and run, and in
this respect the Chenille square has an initial advantage
over the seamless Wilton or tufted Axminster carpets,
which necessitate costly and complicated machinery.
On the other hand, it has its disadvantages. It is not
made in a fineness of pitch which admits of effects of
design obtainable readily in Wilton or even in tufted
Axminster, while, however skilful the setting may be,
there is an inherent tendency to irregularity in the
pattern, which is apt to offend the critical eye. Further,
in the cheaper qualities, which form the great bulk of
the sale, the wearing qualities do not compare favourably
with those of, say, Imperial Axminster. These
disadvantages, however, do not deter that numerous
class of consumers which demands an attractive carpet
at a moderate price.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span><h1>CHAPTER IX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>TAPESTRY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Tapestry</span> is a fabric made alternatively with a looped
pile or a cut pile, which possesses a close affinity to
Brussels and Wilton respectively, in its appearance and
texture. In its method of manufacture, however, it
has something in common with Chenille, inasmuch as
it is essentially a two-process fabric, while the pattern
is wholly in the surface, and is the direct result of the
preliminary and not of the weaving process. No
Jacquard is used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In comparison with its nearest competitors, Brussels
and Wilton, Tapestry is simple in construction, and
economical in the quantity of pile yarn consumed, as
there is only one pile warp-thread carrying the pattern,
as against four or five threads in the two fabrics named.
It also has the advantage of a practically unlimited
range of colours. On the other hand, Tapestry is
expensive in the preparatory processes, and requires a
high degree of technical knowledge and skill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The underlying principle of the fabric, which was
invented by Mr. Richard Whytock, of Edinburgh, in
1852, is the attainment of the economy of using one
frame of worsted yarn by printing or painting the
pattern on the threads, instead of using five frames,
each of a different colour. Several methods have been
tried for printing the pattern on the warp, such as printing
upon the surface either white or dyed, after weaving;
printing the warp threads collectively before weaving;
and printing the warp threads individually. In the two
last named cases the design or part of the design has
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
to be printed in an elongated form to allow for the
reduction caused by the insertion of the wires in weaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Modern Tapestry manufacture, however, has practically
concentrated upon the last-named method; so
that the others can be disregarded for the present
purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='tape'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i079.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0016' style='width:75%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig. 15</span></span><br/>DESIGN OF TAPESTRY CARPET</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>In common with other carpet fabrics, the design for
a Tapestry carpet must be put upon squared paper,
which is preferably, at least, of the actual size. There
is no limitation of colour beyond that imposed by considerations
of taste and of expense. The pitch of the
carpet varies from 7 to 9 per inch, and the beat-up
about the same; but the average quality is about 8
each way.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
The design having been prepared, it passes to the
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
printers, who are responsible for colouring the yarns
in such a way that they can be assembled ready for
producing the correct pattern in the weaving. As the
warp carries the whole of the pattern, and the different
colours of the design are printed on the warp threads,
the design must be read lengthwise. Each square on
the design paper represents a loop of the warp in the
woven carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='tape2'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i080.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0017' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig. 16</span></span><br/>DESIGN IN FIG. 15 ELONGATED AS PRINTED</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The length of colour to be printed on the warp thread
must, of course, bear an accurate relation to the height
of the wire used and the number of wires per inch.
This is a matter of calculation. The length of yarn
consumed in 1 inch is determined. This length, divided
by the number of wires, or loops per inch, gives the
length of warp yarn to be coloured for each wire. Thus,
for a carpet of nine wires to the inch, 3 inches of warp
yarn are required for each inch of the carpet. The length
of each unit of colour to be printed is, therefore,
1/3 in. The mechanism of the printing drum is adjusted
accordingly, and can be varied for different qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The normal yarn used in Tapestry varies in count
from 10s 2 × 2 to 16s 2 × 3 worsted. It is scoured
and dried, and then wound from hanks on to large
bobbins. A set of six of these bobbins, or more or less,
filled with the white yarn, is placed vertically on a stand
in front of the printing drum; and the six ends of worsted
are attached at equal intervals to a triple thread of
worsted stretched across the width of the drum. The
threads, properly tensioned, pass through guides, and
are wound on to the face of the drum, the guides being
mounted on a rod which is slowly moved laterally in
such a manner that the threads are laid side by side
on the surface of the drum. The revolution of the
drum continues until the whole face is covered, or until
the required length of yarn has been wound. In the
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>
latter case, fewer bobbins are put on, and the drum is
left partly uncovered. To fill a drum of ordinary size,
then, there will be required 1,176 threads, which will
be obtained from 196 revolutions. Each of the six
divisions is called a hank, and is tied separately. Whatever
the number of threads and length of the hank, the
whole length of the yarn on the drum represents one
warp thread only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The printing drum is a large roller constructed with
a wooden or tin face supported upon an iron frame
and spokes, the central shaft and external mechanism
being carried upon iron framework. Drums are of
various sizes, varying in circumference from 12 ft. 6 in.
to 40 ft., and in width of face from 18 in. to 72 in.,
capable of carrying from 700 to 1,200 threads side by
side. The most usual width is 30 in. The size of drums
is reckoned by the number of “scrolls” or “types,”
that is, lines of colour, they will carry. These are
commonly 216, 324, 432, 648, 864, or 1,072 scrolls;
but an average size is 648.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An essential part of the drum is the double row of
teeth cut on a metal edge attached to one of the outer
rims of the drum. These are called indices and are
of different pitch, say 648 and 432, corresponding to
one or other of the scrolls. Each tooth is numbered
consecutively, all round the rim; and the indices represent
the total number of scrolls which can be printed,
since the pitch of each tooth permits the drum to
revolve just the width of the scroll pulley. A pawl or
scotcher is arranged so as to engage in each tooth and
stop the drum when required. Before printing, the
drum is covered with strips of oilcloth, which are
removable.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The actual printing or painting of the yarn is effected
by means of the scroll pulley, which revolves in a box
The arrows show where the repeats begin
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
containing the colour, the whole being borne by a
carriage running on rails across the width of the drum
at the bottom of the frame. The colours are made up
by an expert colourist to match the required shades,
and by the admixture of flour and water are brought
to the necessary consistency, which is about that of a
thin paste, so that the colouring matter is dense enough
to adhere, but liquid enough to penetrate the yarn
fibres. In the carriage, the colour roller, which revolves
in the colour, is supported by springs which tend to
give it elasticity and keep it up against the face of the
drum. The carriage is drawn across the drum by a rope
which is mechanically actuated, and, of course, harmonises
with the revolution of the drum. At the end
of each traverse of the colour carriage there is a pause,
which gives the printer time to change the pawl into
the new tooth of the index at which it is required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The printer is guided in his selection of colours for
each scroll that he prints by the “scale board” and
the “design board.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scale boards vary according to the pitch of the design
paper, and according to the length of the design, and
the number of times in which a design repeats in one
revolution of the printing drum. Thus, for a design on
squared paper running seven per inch in its length,
the scale board is marked into divisions of seven to the
inch throughout its length, so as to correspond with the
horizontal divisions on the design paper. Supposing a
design repeats four times in the whole revolution, a
quarter board is employed; if it repeats twice a half
board, the total number of scrolls being divided into
four or two respectively. Thus, if the size of the drum
is 648 scrolls and the number of wires in one repeat of
the pattern is 162, the quarter board will have four
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
vertical columns of figures, running respectively 1-162,
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
163-324, 325-486, and 487-648. The scale board has
a bevel edge, and is preferably arranged so that it can
be moved over the design board and aligned with
the vertical line of the design which the printer is
reproducing.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='scale'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i085.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0019' style='width:70%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig. 18</span></span><br/>SCALE AND DESIGN BOARD COMBINED</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Fig. 18 represents part of a scale and design board
combined. The numbers along the top indicate the
threads in the design, and the printer may be supposed
to be ready to print the eighth thread. The numbers
on the right-hand side represent the wires in the carpet,
with which the numbers on the scale board and the scrolls
in printing correspond. The design is 216 wires long;
and as the number of scrolls the drum will take is 648,
the design is repeated three times in one revolution.
The scale board is numbered in three columns; and for
the first, second, and third repeats of the design, the
printer uses the first, second, and third divisions on
his scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To minimise the danger of bad effects from a colour
running, the rule is to begin printing with the lightest
shade. In this instance, the lightest colour is yellow,
represented (heraldically) by spots, and it occurs first
at the fourth horizontal line. The printer, therefore,
turns the drum by hand, and puts the pawl in tooth
number 4. He then puts the mechanism in gear and
prints the scroll in the manner described, following on
immediately by printing a second scroll at number 5.
He then reads further down the eighth vertical line of
the design, and sees that the colour recurs at 10, 11, 18,
19, 24, and 25. He therefore puts the pawl in the
corresponding teeth of the index consecutively and
prints accordingly. When all the yellow squares
corresponding to the first column of the scale board
have been read, he will take the second column, and
print 220, 221, 226, 227, 234, 235, 240, 241 and so on,
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
and then those in the third column. The remaining
colours will then follow on in order of their delicacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the printing of a drum has been completed,
the next process is scraping. The scroll pulley in the
act of printing always conveys more pigment on to the
yarn than is needed to colour it, a little wall of material
being left on each side of the path of the roller. This
has to be removed, or it would smudge. This is done
by means of small vulcanite tools, bevelled to a blunt
edge, from ½ in. to 2 in. wide, the operator being aided
by a steel bar fixed across the face of the drum as a
guide. Scraping has, however, a further purpose
beyond the removal of superfluous colour, and one no
less important; for by skilful pressure and rubbing, the
colour is caused to penetrate more deeply into the yarn.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='scrape'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i087.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0020' style='width:70%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig. 19</span></span><br/>A SCRAPER</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The yarn, having been printed and scraped, has now to
be taken off the drum; a process known as “stripping.”
The threads are looped together in hanks, and numbered
with a ticket to show which thread each represents in
the design. The drum is so constructed that a section
of it can be drawn inwards upon a telescopic arm of the
drum frame. The yarn is thus released from its tension
round the drum face; and the strippers, inserting long
sticks under the oilcloth, lift it and the yarn clear of
the drum. One side of the frame which carries the
drum shaft is made removable to enable the yarn to
be taken away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The long hanks are then ready for steaming. They
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
are placed with as little handling
as possible upon latticed frames filled
with oat-husks. The frames are then
run into an iron-walled steam-chest,
which is securely closed, and into
which steam is turned at high
pressure. The effect of the steam
pressure and heat is to fix the
colours on the yarn. The operation
takes about half an hour. Some
makers prefer to put the hanks
into net bags for steaming, or
to lay them on network frames,
without the bran. But the first
method described is probably the
best, as the bran tends to absorb
the superfluous colour, and prevents
it from dripping from one hank on
to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After steaming, the hanks are
thoroughly rinsed, preferably by a
large rocking arm fitted with a
hook, in cold running water. The
yarn is then partly dried in a hydro-extractor
and finished in a stove.
Each hank is then wound on to
large bobbins, which are numbered
so that the setters know to which
part of the design each belongs.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The next process is setting. The
object of the operations up to this
point has been to make a set of
warp threads which contain the
pattern of the carpet in an elongated
form in such a way that, when
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
woven in the loom, the loops as seen in the carpet will
accurately reproduce the design. It is the business of
the setters to arrange the threads alongside one another
in proper order and dressing so that they form the
pattern, and to wind them thus arranged on to the warp
beam.</p>

<p class='noindent'>The

and the yarn wound on to the beam, the bobbin-stand

This operation is continued until the whole of the yarn

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The method of weaving is substantially the same as
with Brussels; and except for the pile warp beam,
which is generally placed high up at the back of the
loom, and for the absence of a Jacquard, the mechanism
of the loom is not dissimilar. There are three heald-frames:
two for the two halves of the cotton chain, and
one for the stuffer and the pile warp, the jute and
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
worsted being threaded through two eyelets, one below
the other. The Tapestry loom is run at rather a higher
speed than the Brussels, the Moxon or switch principle
of wire motion, which is generally adopted, tending to
make this possible. A double stuffer, that is, two ends
of jute, of 14 lb. or 16 lb. count, to each reed, is used for
an average quality; and a treble stuffer where greater
weight is required.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Tapestry velvet bears the same relation to the looped
fabric as Wilton does to Brussels, the essential difference
being the use of a knife-ended wire, instead of a round
wire. The use of three weft shots per row of pile is not,
however, the almost invariable rule in Tapestry velvet,
that it is in Wilton.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='velv2'></a></p>

<p class='caption'><span class='bold'><span class='sc'>Fig. 26</span></span><br/>TAPESTRY VELVET. 2 SHOTS IN THE GROUND</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>A three-shot fabric is, of course, more expensive to
make than a two-shot; and there is also the consideration
that, unless the pile is pretty high, the double shot on
the top will tend to make the surface grin. The method,
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
therefore, of using a double shot in the ground is
sometimes adopted. (Fig. 26.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tapestry branch of the carpet trade has naturally
passed through a development similar to that of other
makes, in that it has found the demand passing from
piece goods to sewn breadth squares, and from them
to seamless carpets; and it has progressed accordingly.
The greater part of the Tapestry trade at the present
time is done in squares, and the enquiry for carpets
9 ft. and 12 ft. wide seems to be a growing one. This
tendency throws additional burdens on the manufacturer.
Square carpets involve more designing and
more printing than piece goods; and the amount of
preparation required is a very serious item. Before
one complete carpet can be produced, preparations
have to be made for from 200 to 300, or, in the case of
medallions, double the number. That is one of the
disadvantages of the manufacture; a further defect is
inherent in the fabric. However accurately and carefully
the processes of printing, scraping, setting, and
weaving may be carried out, the transition from one
colour to another cannot be made quite sudden and
complete. The colour will appear to have run; and the
shade which belongs to one wire will tend to trespass
on to the next. This means that with Tapestry it is
never quite possible to produce the clearly-defined
pattern effect, which is produced in Brussels and Wilton,
and which is naturally looked for in all fabrics of
moderately fine pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from this, the Tapestry carpet has much to
commend it. It can be produced and sold at a moderate
price; it can be made seamless, and it has great potentialities
of design; while, for those who like plenty of
colour, the range of shades available is practically
unlimited.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>INGRAIN</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> kind of carpet that is variously called Kidderminster,
Scotch, or Ingrain, differs considerably from any of the
carpets hitherto described. Perhaps essentially, and in
regard to texture, it is most akin to hand-woven Tapestry,
having a flat ribbed surface, without tufts like
Axminster or loops like Brussels.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='twoply'></a></p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The original type of this carpet was the Ingrain or
“Two-ply Super.” It was made with a worsted warp
traversed by a woollen weft, and was woven in pieces
1 yd. wide. The worsted warp was coloured generally
to match the weft, for which two, three, or four shuttles
were employed. The design and colour effect depended
upon the working of the weft, though the incidental
appearance on the surface of the warp threads, which
were harmonious or neutral in shade, did not disturb
the pattern. There were 1,088 warp ends for a full
super warp to the 36 in. width of fabric, two to each
reed, equal to 544, or a pitch of about 15 per inch;
while the beat-up contained 14 pairs of weft to the
inch, that is, 14 above and 14 below. This fineness
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
of pitch and beat-up admitted of delicate and ambitious
designing, and of clever and artistic effects in spite of
the limitation of colours. The writer has seen an
American Ingrain carpet, date about 1893, representing
the landing of Columbus, which was admirably drawn
and shaded, and at a little distance might easily have
been mistaken for a hand-made Tapestry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ingrain carpet was made in large quantities at
one time in the 36 in. width in Scotland, the North of
England, and in the United States, but is more or less
obsolete at the present time, having given way before
other types.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Developments have been in various directions, different
manufacturers having pursued different improvements
in looms or in textures; but the tendency of the
development has been mainly in the direction of rather
heavier fabrics and wider looms. There are at least
as many as twenty different qualities in this branch of
the carpet trade at the present time, varying from each
other in more or less important particulars. It must
suffice, however, to describe one or two of the fabrics,
illustrating variations of the Ingrain principle, the
original type of which has been indicated above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of recent years there has been a considerable demand
for plain colours, and these can be made either in the
twill or the plain weave. In these fabrics both warp
and weft are dyed, with the object of obtaining a solid
effect. For a twill, four gears are required; but the
plain or “Oatmeal” surface can be obtained from two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For two-colour effects, there are double warps, one
of each colour, each warp working with the weft of the
same shade. A two-ply carpet is thus formed in such
a way that the design shows on each surface but with
the colours reversed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alternatively, a two-colour effect can be produced
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>
from wefts of two shades only, working with a black
or neutral chain, the pattern being obtained entirely
from the appearance on the surface, above the chain,
of the dyed weft.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='twowarp'></a></p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Where a more ambitious colour effect is desired, four
warps, each of a different colour, can be employed
instead of two pairs. These, combined in different ways
with four wefts of various colours, obviously give scope
for a great variety of shade and design.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='threew'></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called Art Squares—not a very satisfactory
name—are generally made with two coloured warps,
one cotton chain, and one jute stuffer beam. The design
is operated, as, of course, in many other kinds of loom,
by a Jacquard mechanism. The blanks or perforations
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
in the pattern cards cause some of the chain threads to
be lifted up while others are left down, the space between
them forming the shed, through which the shuttle
passes, carrying the weft. Where the chain ends only
are lifted, the weft will show; where the stuffer is raised,
it will cover the weft. There may be three or four
shuttles, each carrying a different coloured weft, and
one or other of the wefts will appear on the surface of
the carpet all along the shot, while the remainder will
remain hidden. Sometimes one shuttle carries a cotton
weft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some weaves the black stuffer is occasionally
brought to the surface so as to obtain an additional
effect, or, alternatively, a two-colour chain warp is
employed, without a stuffer.</p>

<p class='pindent'><a id='threeply'></a></p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i096.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0031' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>A more complicated variety of weave can be made
with three sets of warp threads, each of two colours,
alternately, and six wefts correspondingly coloured.
This produces a fabric of three textures, which are
fastened to each other at the point of interchange.
If, therefore, the design should involve a large area of
one colour or effect, this area is apt to be loose and
baggy, covering a pocket, which is not attached to
the rest of the fabric. This defect, however, can be
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
overcome by utilising one of the warps or wefts to act
as a binding thread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As has been intimated above, modern developments
of Ingrain carpets have tended in the direction of wide
seamless carpets, in which respect the fabric is on the
same lines as other classes of carpeting. The bulk of
the trade now lies in the wide carpets, and comparatively
few breadth goods are woven. The modern Art Square
loom is a fine piece of mechanism, inspiring admiration
with its comparatively small Jacquard, its mass of
cordage, and its ingenious co-ordinated motions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Modern developments of fabrics have also been in
the direction of heavier goods and coarser pitches.
Most qualities now being made contain 1,088 warp ends
to the yard, in stuffer and chain combined. The yarn
now used is heavier, as it has been realised that a carpet
needs weight, both for the sake of wearing qualities, and
in order that it may lie well on the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preliminary and final processes in the manufacture
of Ingrain carpets are substantially the same, as regards
winding, beaming, finishing, etc., as for other fabrics;
and these have been already described. Mention may
be made, however, of a warping mill for preparing the
warp beams for wide carpets. The yarns are wound from
bobbins fixed in a frame, in some convenient multiple
of the number of ends required, on to a large reel frame
or warping mill, which revolves on either a vertical or
horizontal axis. This frame has a diameter of about
12 ft., so as to enable a long length of warp to be wound
upon it. When the required number of ends of the
desired lengths have been wound, they are unwound
from the reel on to a beam, which can be fitted into the
beaming machine, and detached again, so as to go into
the loom. The beaming machine is adjustable to take
different widths of beam.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
Compared with some carpet fabrics, Ingrain must
take a modest place. The effects of design and colour
of which it is capable are limited; and though, in theory,
the combination of three or four wefts, with as many
warps of similar or different colours, gives an almost
indefinite potential number of colour combinations, yet
in practice these have their limits. It will be generally
conceded that Ingrain carpets are most effective in
simple and severe designs, using few colours. Nor can
it claim to be a luxurious carpet to tread upon. Even
the heaviest Ingrain lacks the resiliency, which the
looped pile gives to even a cheap Brussels or Tapestry.
On the other hand, it can be very artistic within its
limitations; and it has the merit of being made in wide
seamless carpets, and of these carpets being clean in
wear and easily handled.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>DESIGN AND COLOUR</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Carpet</span> designing is a branch of Applied Art which
makes exacting demands upon its adherents, requiring
as it does technical knowledge to an exceptional extent.
The average designer who ventures into this field,
however high his artistic ability may be, is not likely
to achieve a practical success, unless and until he has
studied the particular capacities and limitations of
carpet fabrics. For this reason, the public carpet
designer is more or less of a specialist in his domain,
which is rarely invaded unless by such exceptional
craftsmen as the late Walter Crane or Voysey. Similarly,
and because there are so many varieties of carpet
fabrics, requiring special knowledge and treatment,
all carpet manufacturers maintain private staffs of
designers, whose business it is to produce new patterns
for each season and quality in accordance with the
commercial requirements. For the manufacturer has
to be governed to a great extent by the tastes and
inclinations of his customers, the carpet dealers, and cannot
afford to be too enterprising in initiating novelties,
while the carpet dealer, in his turn is, as a rule, rather a
follower than a leader of the public taste. The commercial
standard has, therefore, been to some extent
a hampering influence upon the progress of carpet
design towards perfection, but it is certainly less so
than in the past. For it has been modified of recent
years by a new tendency, which, however, is not one
of unmixed advantage to the manufacturer.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
This tendency may be expressed as the intervention
of the consumer. Scarcity of materials during the war,
and the consequent obligation of carpet dealers to accept
what they can get from manufacturers has, temporarily
at any rate, modified the influence of the individual
buyer of carpets upon carpet design and colour; but
previous to the war it had become a factor to be reckoned
with. There were, and are, many householders possessed
of definite ideas upon arrangement of design, combination
of colour, and harmony of decoration; and these
ideas often germinate in suggestions or demands conveyed
through the dealer to the manufacturer for single
carpets of special colouring or arrangement. Often
these suggestions prove to be more original than effective;
but often they lead to effects both artistic and saleable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This critical and creative spirit on the part of the
individual is not, therefore, to be despised by the
technical expert. It encourages novelty, and tends
towards the evolution of new ideas in design and colour,
and a liberation from an excessive dominance of the
commercial standard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From whatever source, however, the carpet manufacturer
obtains his ideas for a design, it is by his expert
staff, or by a professional carpet designer, that the ideas
must be reduced to a practical form. And the technical
preparation of designs for carpets is as full of difficulty
as it is of interest. As has been indicated, the various
makes of carpet differ from each other in many respects,
including that of pitch, or number of threads or rows
per inch. They all, however, have this in common,
that, anatomically so to speak, as regards design, they
are reducible to squares of colour. For this reason,
ruled or point paper is always employed in the preparation
of the design, and preferably paper ruled so
as to represent the full size of the woven fabric. The
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
designer, therefore, may not represent the curved outline
of a leaf, for instance, with a bold sweep of his
brush, but must paint it carefully, square by square,
leaving actually an outline, which is more or less jagged
according to the coarseness or fineness of the pitch.
Here, at once we recognise a limitation which is apt to
be irksome to the untrained designer of carpets. And
what applies to form applies also to colour. There is
no imperceptible graduation of shade to be achieved.
Each particular square has to be of one colour and no
more. Again, the designer must consider the number
of colours he is allowed to employ, be they two or a
hundred; and must know whether they can be used
anywhere or only in restricted places in the pattern.
Then there is the consideration of the repeat, with the
mysteries of the straight match, reverse, drop and
half drop; of the width of the fabric, body and border;
and of the various adjustments of design required for
carpets of different sizes, whether breadth goods,
Chlidema squares, medallions, or seamless. Last, there
is the real artistic imagination that is required; the art
of seeing from one repeat how a complete carpet will
look, of estimating the difference in appearance between
the flat colour on the paper and the richness of the wool;
of the variation in value of the same shade in collocation
with this or with that. From the above it will be
seen that the successful carpet designer has to be both
craftsman and artist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The finished coloured design passes into the hands of
the colourist, who, whatever be the nature of the
subsequent manufacturing process, will have the responsibility
of selecting the coloured yarns to go into
the fabric. These will normally, in the first instance,
follow the main lines of the shades of the design paper.
Then the travellers’ samples are made; and in some
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
fabrics even, where pattern making is not practicable,
whole carpets or sets of carpets are produced. Some
idea can thus be obtained of the expenses to which
carpet manufacturers are put in the preparation of new
designs and colourings (which, in pre-war times, used
to be done annually, and even more often) before a
yard of carpet is sold to recoup them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carpet designer and colourist must have strict
regard for the limitations of his medium, and in particular
the limitations of pitch and of colour. He must
know how to employ in the most effective manner,
thirty shades or three, and what treatment is best for
a floral design or an Oriental, in a fine or a coarse pitch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, the same laws of colour harmonies and
contrasts hold good for the carpet colourist, as for the
artist in any other branches of applied art; but the
carpet artist has his own particular problems, such as
those that have been indicated, and such as arise, for
instance, from the fact that carpets have wool surfaces
and lie on the floor, and therefore bear quite a different
relation to the decoration of a room than curtains or
ceilings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carpet colourings, apart from plains, may be analysed
into self-colour effects, two-colour effects, and effects
of three or more colours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Self-colour or tone-on-tone effects adapt themselves
more easily to a scheme of decoration than carpets
containing contrasted colours. It seems to be a fact
that the carpet is about the last thing to be thought of
in a scheme of decoration. It need not be discussed
whether it ought to be so or not. The walls, curtains,
tiles, etc., are decided upon before the question of the
colour of the carpet arises. In such a case, if a harmonious
effect is to be ensured, there may be little choice
left in the matter; and a self-coloured carpet may be
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
either the easiest way out of the difficulty, or an artistic
necessity. Certainly it is easier to furnish to; and, if it
does mean a certain want of ambition in the decorative
scheme, it is simple and satisfying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Self-coloured carpets are also eminently suitable for
small rooms, especially bed-rooms, on the one hand,
and for theatres and music halls on the other, perhaps
because one colour is more restful than several.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of shades used varies from two to five,
according to the simplicity or boldness of the design.
More than five are certainly undesirable, as it becomes
impossible to get steps of shades without approaching a
white at the top and a black at the bottom; and, indeed,
some of the most effective self-colours are made in three
shades only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two-tone effects of contrasted colours are not greatly
used. They are sometimes employed in small designs,
with two colours only, or three (one and a contrasting
pair), but more often in bold designs of the Empire,
Adam, or Wedgwood style, with three or four shades
of one colour, upon a ground, or working against a pair
of shades, of another; but effective combinations on
these lines are rare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By far the largest proportion of carpets made are
multi-coloured; and nearly every style and fabric is
adaptable to treatment in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible to deal properly with the question of
many-coloured carpets except at great length; but, as
a basis, it may be useful to remember that there are only
three primary colours, and that in every multi-coloured
carpet there should be represented some red, some
yellow, and some blue. That is not saying that these
should be primaries. The red may be a terra-cotta,
the yellow a tan, the blue a slate. But if you have
forty shades in a carpet they can all (except, of course,
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
black and white) be scientifically analysed into reds,
yellows, and blues, even if some of them are secondaries
or tertiaries. That is to say, that, according to its
collocation, a purple will be acting either as a blue or as a
red, a green either as a yellow or as a blue, and so on.
It follows, therefore, that in practice the carpet designer
or colourist who has a large range of colours at his
disposal will arrange them in sets: a tan with a cream,
three blues, two reds and a ruby, and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this point of view, the manufacturer of Wilton
is not so hopelessly outclassed by the maker of Axminster
and Chenille. With his five or six colours, irrespective
of planting, he can produce an effect which is satisfying,
and artistically perfect; though he may have to use one
shade, where two or three would give additional softness
and richness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much, however, depends on the nature of the design;
and it is obvious that if it is desired to represent, say,
a flower in a naturalistic manner, the fabric that commands
a large number of colours, combined with a
reasonably fine pitch, will come off best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A dictum of that eminent art-critic, Owen Jones,
may perhaps be appropriately quoted at this point.
In a lecture on Decorative Art he writes—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carpets should be darker in tone and more broken
in line than any portion of a room, both because they
present the largest mass of colour, and because they
serve as a background to the furniture placed upon
them. As a general rule, lighter carpets may be used in
rooms thinly furnished than the contrary, as we should
otherwise have too overpowering a mass of shade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All ornament, according to the source and principle
of its design, may be classified as either geometric,
naturalistic, or conventional. Ornament of the first
class consists of apparently arbitrary arrangements of
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
circles, squares, spirals, or intersecting lines, or repetitions
of simple figures. It is the natural form of
expression of primitive art, as employed by savages or
found on prehistoric remains; but it has been developed
in some style, as, for example, the Moorish, into elaborate
and beautiful patterns. Naturalistic ornament is that
which is closely based upon natural objects, especially
flowers and leaves, which are coloured as closely as the
limitations of the material permit. Conventional ornament,
which may probably be regarded as the highest
class, is based upon observation of nature; but the
natural forms are not slavishly copied, but conventionalised,
in the sense of being selected and simplified,
and adapted to the decorative purpose in view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This classification holds good of carpet design, as for
other domains of applied art; and it may be interesting
to trace the development of the fashion of carpet
decoration with this classification in view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The geometric style is characteristic of the youthful
days of British carpets, and was at its zenith in Early
Victorian times. Designs of this class, rather elaborate
than simple in drawing, were associated with bright and
strongly contrasted colours, while black grounds, at
once the most effective and the most difficult of all
ground shades, were greatly in vogue. It is interesting
to note that of late we have returned to the use of
black, for many years an outlaw colour; though it is
employed now in a more artistic manner than it was
sixty years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the later Victorian times is associated the
development of the naturalistic style in carpets as in
other decorative fabrics; flowers, singly or in bouquets,
being depicted in bright colours as near to Nature as
the technical limitations permitted. This style may
perhaps be regarded as flourishing until gradually
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>
checked or sobered by conventionalising influences, and
notably that of William Morris, to whom, indeed, it is
not too much to attribute a revolution in the decorative
point of view. But this revolution was both slow and
partial; and the naturalistic style, founded, as it is no
doubt, upon a love of Nature innate in man, is too
deeply rooted ever to lose its popularity completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is still with us. And why not? Flowers, though
not meant to be trodden under foot, are round about
our feet; and they make a double appeal to the carpet
designer of intrinsic beauty, and of fitness for ground
decoration. A green ground carpet with pink roses,
as near as may be to life, represents no doubt
something of the aspiration of the dweller in town for
the country; and who shall say that it is unworthy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Owen Jones is again worth quoting in this connection,
even if his strictures seem excessively severe. He says—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will say no more on the floral style, but to express
a regret that, the more perfect the manufacturing
process in carpets becomes, the more do they (the
carpets) appear to lend themselves to evil. The modest
Kidderminster carpet rarely goes wrong, because it
cannot; it has to deal with but two colours, and consequently
much mischief is beyond its reach. The
Brussels carpet, which deals with five colours, is more
mischievous. The Tapestry carpet, where the colours
are still more numerous, are vicious in the extreme;
whilst the recent invention of printed carpets, with no
bounds to its ambition, has become positively criminal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the supremacy of the naturalistic style long since
passed away, and gave place towards the end of last
century to the conventional, There was a very definite
movement in this direction, arising perhaps in the first
instance from the Morris influence, but carried forward
notably by <span class='it'>The Studio</span>, the Arts and Crafts Exhibition,
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>
and by such artists as C. F. A. Voysey, Walter Crane,
G. C. Haité, Arthur Silver, and many others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conventional style is particularly suitable to
carpets, in that it possesses great decorative possibilities,
and continually reminds the occupant of a
room of beautiful objects in Nature, without deliberately
challenging, as in the naturalistic style, comparisons,
which can only be disadvantageous. This style reached
the summit of its popularity about the first years of
the century and has since declined, though it is by no
means extinct. Its decline may be regretted, if only
for the reason that it is one of the very few styles of
design in carpets which can claim to be distinctly
British.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It left behind it a successor, however, which enjoyed
a few years of public favour. This is the tapestry or
verdure style, wherein flowers, fruit, and leaves are
treated in a half-conventional manner, generally on a
well-covered ground. This really stands half-way
between the naturalistic and the conventional styles.
It may be the joint offspring of the two, a more exuberant
Morris type, or a more chastened floral chintz; while it
seems not unlikely that it was introduced from Germany,
where it was certainly very popular at one time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we passed into an era of reproductions.
Examples of masterpieces of decoration, and especially
those of Oriental art, have always, and rightly, been
studied by carpet designers, and frequently reproduced
by carpet manufacturers in the past; but never to
such an extent as during the years preceding the war.
The carpet trade of that time was dominated by the
cult of the antique Eastern carpet; and a very large
proportion of the production of British carpets was
upon Persian and Indian styles, while subsequently the
Chinese came in for marked attention. From one point
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>
of view, this was all to the good; for the birthplace of
the carpet was the Orient, and old Eastern carpets are
classics, just as the works of Homer, Vergil, Handel,
or Velasquez are classics. Competition among manufacturers
was keen; and close and beautiful reproductions
of the best antique Oriental carpets were offered
to the public, distinguished in design, soft in colouring,
and lending themselves readily to harmonious schemes
of decoration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from another aspect this era was less satisfactory.
The masterpieces of Persia and Asia Minor, so eagerly
sought out, were not studied as models, to be adapted
to modern ideas and requirements, as inspirations, or
bases for new effects. They were apt to be slavishly
copied, line for line and shade for shade, as far as the
limitations of the machine-made fabric permitted.
A manufacturer would boast: “This is an exact reproduction
of the famous carpet of so-and-so, made in the
fourteenth century”; not: “This is a beautiful carpet.
Persian in feeling.” This sort of thing did not make
for progress, nor for originality and initiative in the
design, but led to a certain monotony and arrested
progress, though the beauty of the productions was
incontestable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next stage in the development of carpet design
was very interesting. A slight, but inevitable reaction
set in against the dominance of close reproductions of
Persian and other carpets of the Near East. Carpets
in the characteristic decorative styles of other countries,
and of other ages, were attempted. The Far East
furnished the first departure from the Persian domination;
and the rich stores of Chinese and Japanese
ornament were drawn upon, with very satisfactory
results. Then the carpet manufacturer and designer
struck out more boldly, and invaded any land or period
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
whose particular style of decoration could be converted
to the artistic purposes of the industry. Louis XIV,
Louis XVI, Rococo, Italian Renaissance, Empire, Adam,
Georgian, Queen Anne, and other periods were laid under
contribution; and it was no less a clear demand on the
part of the dealer and the public (to whose share due
credit must be given) than a point of honour with the
manufacturer, that every design should be pure and
true to its particular style. This involved knowledge
and study, and tended to restore the designer and
colourist to his proper position as a creative artist from
that of a mere copyist, to which he had been in some
danger of sinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Futurist, Cubist, Vorticist movement, whatever
its effect has been in the world of Fine Art, has had
but little influence upon carpet design and colour.
But perhaps this is yet to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There has been one more stage in the development
of carpet design, which may be regarded as a part of,
but slightly different from, the period-study stage.
This may be called the Archaeological. The art of
Greece and Rome, apart from the superb acanthus
scroll, has left little that lent itself to carpet decoration;
but older civilisations have been drawn upon; and the
finely conventionalised ornament of Ancient Egypt,
Chaldea, and Assyria, has been utilised in harmonious
and dignified carpets. Nor is this tendency likely to
be arrested, as long as fresh fields can be found that
will repay exploration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this is extremely healthy and stimulating for the
industry. It involves study and effort and originality;
and it makes for real progress. The consumer of carpets
has been growing more discriminating, just as he has
been growing more eclectic. His taste is varied: he
may buy a Hamadan design or a Celtic; but he will
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
want it pure in style, and well coloured. He is interested
in a little archaeology; but he likes a sound design better
than archaeology, and finds a good colouring more
important still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What developments the future holds in store it is
impossible to say. It may be that we shall have a
reaction from this, eclecticism, this cosmopolitanism of
taste, to a more insular vogue; that we shall even
evolve a Twentieth Century British style in carpets as
characteristic as the Egyptian or the Renaissance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, some indication has been given of the
steps by which the carpet trade has reached the high
and varied standard of excellence in design and colour
which it enjoys to-day.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>STATISTICS</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The</span> British carpet manufacturing trade cannot claim
to compare in size with the larger industries of the
country; but the figures which follow will give some
measure of its extent. It should be premised that,
owing to the disturbance of the industry caused by
war conditions, it is necessary to go back to 1913 to
obtain figures which can be regarded as approximately
normal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are forty-five firms engaged in the manufacture
of carpets, of whom eleven are located in Scotland,
nine in the North of England, eighteen in Kidderminster
and district, and seven in other parts of the country.
Kidderminster is thus, both in the number of manufacturers,
and in its productive capacity, the most
important centre of the trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are about 4,500 looms of various kinds and
widths in the whole trade, of which number Brussels
and Wilton looms, Chenille, and Tapestry each contribute
about 25 per cent., Axminster 17½ per cent.,
and Ingrain, hand-tufted, and sundry looms the balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The total number of employees in the trade before
the war was 36,000, of which rather more than one-quarter
were male. During the war the total was
reduced to about 50 per cent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The average annual consumption of wool may be
taken as about 8,000 tons; which, estimating a fleece as
about 6lb. in weight, represents the wool produced
yearly by 3,000,000 sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consumption of jute was from 15,000 to 20,000
tons; of cotton about 13,000 tons; of linen 8,000 to
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
10,000 tons; and of coal about 100,000 tons per
annum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The export trade is an important branch, as will be
seen from the following tables for 1913 and 1918, printed
here by the courtesy of the <span class='it'>Kidderminster Shuttle</span> —</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Carpet</span> manufacture, as already explained in the
foregoing pages, comprises a good many different
processes and fabrics; and it can be readily understood
that the making of Wilton carpets, for instance, may
require not only a different plant and staff from those
needed for Ingrain or Axminster, but even a different
manufacturing and selling policy. From these and
other considerations it comes about that, in practice,
carpet manufacturers are inclined to specialise in one
fabric, and to restrict themselves to making two or
three, though this is not to be regarded as by any
means an invariable rule. As a result, the interest in
any one fabric will be found to be confined to a limited
number of manufacturers, and not to be extended over
the whole trade; while nearly all manufacturers are
interested in more than one fabric.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In default of any general association of carpet manufacturers,
the tendency in the past has been for the
whole or the large majority of manufacturers interested
in a fabric to form an Association for the control of
qualities and prices in that fabric only. Thus, A, B, C,
and D make Axminster carpets and form an Axminster
Association; B, C, D, and E are members of a Brussels
and Wilton Association; A, C, E, and F of a Tapestry
Association, and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of fact, there have been in existence for
a good many years a Brussels and Wilton Carpet
Manufacturers’ Association, working in close co-operation
with an Axminster Association, and a Victorian
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
(Chenille) Association; while the makers of Tapestry
carpets have an organisation of their own. Of recent
years, another body was added, the Carpet Manufacturers’
Federation, whose special function was the
control of the lower qualities of Brussels and Wilton,
which the existing Brussels and Wilton Association did
not claim to regulate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The organisations enumerated comprise the large
majority of the makers of the various carpet fabrics
concerned; and they have controlled the prices and
terms obtaining in the trade on the whole in a very
effective manner, though subject always to the somewhat
disturbing influence of the manufacturers remaining
outside the Associations. Of these, however, the greater
number have habitually followed the standard of prices
and selling conditions set by the Associations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole, then, these trade organisations have
done good work. Certainly they cannot be accused
of greediness in advancing prices too quickly or too
much, or of undue stringency in conditions of sale.
The value and amount of control exercised by these
Associations have been partly conditioned by their
mutual relations. Intercommunication between the
different bodies and joint meetings has already contributed
to the solution of some difficulties common
to the trade; but more might be done in this direction.
No doubt an ideal organisation would be an Association
of the whole industry, with sections for each branch
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work of the Associations has included the standardisation
of a certain number of qualities in various fabrics;
and, indeed, without such standardisation the fixing of
prices in a satisfactory manner is almost an impossibility.
In the interests of all concerned, including, it may be
confidently asserted, both the carpet dealer and the
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
ultimate consumer, this standardisation, coupled with
a reduction in the number of qualities produced, might
very well be extended. The trade has been unnecessarily
complicated in the past by the existence of
qualities differing from each other by a small percentage
of value, and puzzling to the buyer. Carpet manufacturers
are themselves partly to blame for this multiplication
of fabrics, the outcome of an extravagant
competition, involving needless expense in production,
which fell, of course, ultimately upon the consumer.
War conditions have made a clean sweep of many of
them: it is to be hoped that they will not recur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The carpet industry was from the first a great sufferer
from the state of affairs brought about by the declaration
of war. In the early days, cancels and a suspension of
orders necessitated a recourse to short time; while later,
as a so-called “Luxury Trade,” it did not seem likely
to meet with much consideration at the hands of the
authorities in respect of protection given to its personnel,
or of the provision of adequate raw materials. These
difficulties brought carpet manufacturers closer together
than before; and committees representing the whole
trade were formed for the protection of its interests in
the above connections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ultimately, when the question of the rationing of
wool and other raw materials necessary to the industry
became paramount, a Committee of the trade was
formed, entitled the Carpet Trade Rationing Committee.
This Committee was recognised by the War Office,
and responsible directly to the Wool Control Board.
Since June, 1917, it was occupied with the allocation
of wool to spinners, and of worsted and woollen yarns,
and subsequently jute, to carpet manufacturers. The
distribution, of course, depended upon the amount
allotted to the carpet trade by the Wool Control Board,
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
and had to be made with due regard to the needs of
carpet manufacturers, their pre-war consumption, their
stocks, etc. It was an arduous and invidious task; and
the fact that it was carried through with scarcely a
complaint, and that, in spite of severe shortage of
material at times, no firm was ever obliged to shut
down, reflects great credit on all concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Labour was represented on this Committee by one
member from each branch of the Carpet Trade Unions,
in Scotland, the North of England, and Kidderminster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The publication of the Whitley Report brought
general recognition that effective co-operation of
employers and employed was a necessity for the future
prosperity of the carpet industry, no less than for other
trades, and that this could best be brought about by
an organisation as fully representative of the employers
as the Affiliation of Carpet Trade Unions was of the
employees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of 1918 a scheme was put forward
by the late Sir Charles Bine Renshaw for the formation
of a British Carpet Manufacturers’ Association for the
whole trade, composed of delegates from three District
Associations, representing the Scottish, North of England,
and Kidderminster Area Carpet Manufacturers respectively.
The object of these Associations was the protection
of the general interests of the trade, and in
particular the settlement of questions of wages and
employment in co-operation with accredited representatives
of Carpet Trade Unions. The Scottish Manufacturers
were the first to form their District Association,
but were followed in due course by those of the other
two areas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Trade Unions of the carpet industry were naturally
local in origin. The Midland branch was founded in
1866, under the title “The Kidderminster and Stourport
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
United Brussels Power Loom Carpet Weavers’ Friendly
Society.” In 1868, the name was altered to “The
Power Loom Carpet Weavers’ Mutual Defence and
Provident Association,” though generally spoken of as
the Carpet Weavers’ Association; and this title held
good until 1917, when the textile workers, both male
and female, were admitted to membership, and the
name was finally altered to “The Power Loom Carpet
Weavers’ and Textile Workers’ Association.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original headquarters of the Society was the
Vine Inn, Horsefair; but in 1870 a room was rented
from the Workmen’s Club, at 28 Church Street, where
the business was carried on up to 1887. In this year
the Association was transferred to 105 Mill Street,
where it has remained until its recent move next door,
to No. 106.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the original <span class='it'>raison d’être</span> of the organisation
was that of a Trade Defence Association, it very soon
took up what is known as Friendly Society work; for
as early as 1867 accident and funeral benefits were
being paid; sick pay was commenced in 1868; and in
1877 it was decided to use funds for superannuation
claims. It is interesting to record that at the beginning
of 1919 there were 52 members on the superannuation
list, including some of the men who helped to found
the Association, such as Noah Cooke (85), Thomas
Thatcher (95), B. Barber, and several others now well
advanced in years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Association has gradually extended the scope of
its benefits to members until we find that, for the year
ending December, 1917, out of an income of £1,717 0s. 8d.
no less than £1,391 19s. 10d. was disbursed in Friendly
Society benefits, subscriptions, and donations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following figures, showing the total amounts
paid out for benefits to the sick and disabled, for
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
superannuation, and for funerals, will convey some
idea of the great extent of the activity of the Society
in this direction since its formation —</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to these amounts, various sums have
been applied to other useful purposes. For instance,
in the year 1897, £221 was spent in assisting members
who were unemployed, and in succeeding years several
smaller amounts have been spent in the same way.
Over £130 was distributed in 1906 to members who wished
to emigrate, and later about £100 for the same purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thanks to the good relations which have subsisted
between employers and employed, and which it is to be
hoped will continue, the amount spent in trade disputes
has been very small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the most flourishing days of the Brussels and
Wilton trade, the actual number of members on the
books reached 1,600. This gradually fell to 800,
including superannuated members, in the early part
of 1917. In that year, however, the rules were altered
to admit the textile workers to membership; and the
number on the books at the beginning of 1919 was
rather over 3,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Association has a long and honourable record to
look back upon. It has played a useful part in the
industrial life of the community, it has treated its
members well, and has earned the respect of the manufacturers.
No doubt, under the new conditions, it will
do no less well in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Northern Counties Carpet Trades Association was
established in 1892 by a few enthusiasts at Halifax,
under the title of “The Halifax Brussels Carpet Weavers’
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
Association.” Membership was confined to those working
as Jacquard weavers until June, 1904, when the
name was changed to “The Northern Counties Power
Loom Weavers’ Association,” making it possible to
accept as members all power-loom weavers. A further
alteration was made in the title and constitution in
1913, when the Association was registered under its
present name, since when it has accepted as members
any person engaged in the industry. The Association
has branches at Halifax, Sowerby Bridge, Heckmondwike,
Rochdale, and Manchester, with a membership
of approximately 1,200. Up to the end of 1918 the
Association has disbursed in provident benefits the
following amounts —</p>

<p class='pindent'>Payment of sick pay was discontinued when the
National Health Insurance Act came into force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Previous to 1874, the interests of the workers in the
carpet trade in Scotland were vested in a more or less
irregular form of a Trade Union, whose activities were
mainly directed by the workers in Glasgow; but with
the development of the Trade Union movement in the
seventies, several efforts were made by a few enthusiasts
to form a regular society. After many futile attempts
in this direction, a conference was ultimately held in
the St. Mungo Hotel, Glasgow, on 7th March, 1874,
when the following attended as representatives of their
respective districts —</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bonnyrigg.</span>—Mr. John Craig.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Glasgow.</span>—Messrs. John Mitchell, Robert Logan,
Thomas Ramsay.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
<span class='sc'>Glenpatrick</span> (Elderslie).—Messrs. John Miller, James
McLellan.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Paisley.</span>—Messrs. James McNaughton, William
Findlay.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Roslin</span> (Mid-Lothian).—Mr. James Armour.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Kilmarnock.</span>—Mr. James Young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. William Findlay, of Paisley, was called to preside
over the conference; and Mr. Thomas Ramsay, of
Glasgow, was appointed Secretary. After the various
representatives had expressed their opinions for and
against the formation of a Union on progressive lines,
it was ultimately agreed that a Protective and Provident
Union be formed, and that members be given the option
of joining either for Trade Protection and Sick and
Funeral Benefit, or for Trade Protection only, by paying
the weekly contribution of 4d. or 2d. per week respectively.
It was further decided at this conference that
the first Executive Committee be composed of six
members from Glasgow, and one each from Paisley and
Glenpatrick. Thus we have the origin of the present
“Scotch Power Looms Carpet Trade Protective and
Provident Association.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the constitution of the Association as it
then existed, the Executive Committee had the power
to appoint its own officials; and on 9th March, 1874,
Mr. Robert Logan and Mr. Thomas Ramsay, both of
the Glasgow Branch, were elected President and
Secretary respectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a meeting held on 19th April, 1874, the Secretary
intimated that the organisation was proceeding very
satisfactorily. Up to this date, 102 members had
joined for the full benefits and 83 for trade benefits;
Bonnyrigg being the only branch which had not
responded to the call for organisation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In February, 1875, a joint conference with the
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>
English workers was held in Halifax, for the dual
purpose of soliciting assistance for the Glenpatrick
workers, who were then on strike, and with a view
to a thorough organisation of the whole of the workers
in the trade. Some good financial assistance was
obtained, but the organisation was not as successful
as might have been expected, although Kidderminster
placed their experience at the disposal of all the workers,
The next few years were taken up in purely local
affairs; and in February, 1881, the question of an uniform
price list for Tapestry weaving and tying-in was discussed;
and a draft scheme was submitted to a meeting
of delegates. However, as complete agreement among
the workers could not be obtained, the efforts in this
direction did not materialise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From 1894 onwards, the Association realised the
necessity of a more powerful organisation and sufficient
funds to support the members; and strong recommendations
were repeatedly put forward by the Executive
for increased contributions; but owing to apparent
apathy on the part of members, these recommendations
were not taken up with the zeal necessary for their
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Annual Delegates’ Meeting held in May, 1895,
the question of replenishing the funds of the Association,
which had been greatly depleted, was discussed; and it
was ultimately decided to raise the contributions from
4d. to 6d. per week. As a result of this increase, two
of the branches in the East of Scotland seceded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In July, 1895, the question of amalgamating with the
Kidderminster Association was again discussed; but
again no definite steps were taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1897 an effort was made by the East shops (Bonnyrigg,
Eskbank, and Roslin) to form a local union. This
was partially established, but in June, 1904, a lock-out
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
took place in the district on the question of shift working;
and the local union, not being able to deal with the
matter, appealed to the Executive of this Association
for assistance, which was granted. The Executive
opened negotiations with the firms concerned, and after
a few weeks duration, a satisfactory agreement was
arrived at, with the result that the local union was
dissolved, and the members agreed to join the original
Association. In March, 1895, the membership of the
Association was returned at 397.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A special conference was held in Glasgow on 30th
September, 1905, with the object of endeavouring to
get the employers to return to the rates for tying
beams which were reduced in 1886. A scheme was
ultimately drawn up and submitted to the employers
in 1906; but negotiations proved unproductive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1905, the Glenpatrick branch, which had seceded
in 1875 after their unsuccessful strike, rejoined the
Association, some 72 weavers becoming members. In
March, 1906, the membership of the Association was
returned at 462.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In May, 1906, a dispute arose in the Charleston
(Paisley) branch on the question of the weaving rate
for a new fabric, which lasted about four months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1907 the Association became affiliated to the
General Federation of Trade Unions with a view to
strengthening the reserve funds of the Association.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1907 and 1908, a further effort was made to bring
about an affiliation of the English and Scotch Carpet
Trade Unions; and on this occasion a constitution was
drawn up, but at the last moment, when all seemed
shaping well for the formation of a Federation, the
matter again dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1911, after prolonged negotiations with the Tapestry
manufacturers, a new scheme for payment for weaving
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
was drawn up on a proportionate basis, which was
considered, at least so far as Scotland was concerned,
to be a great step towards uniformity of rates. The
workers’ interests in the drawing up of this scheme were
very capably handled by Messrs. Rough, Robertson, and
Howie. After the establishment of this scheme, things
went on smoothly until August, 1914, when the outbreak
of war put the organisation, in common with many
others, into a condition of suspense. The General
Secretary was called to the Colours; and a large proportion
of the younger members answered the call to arms.
Thanks, however, to careful and judicious handling, the
Association ultimately overcame all difficulties; and not
only was the Association preserved, but that which
was almost despaired of, and which was the dream of
the pioneers of the movement, was also achieved:
namely, the complete organisation of all carpet workers
in the Brussels, Wilton, and Tapestry carpet trade of
Scotland. By the end of 1918, the membership of the
Association, in spite of the great depletion in the ranks
of the workers caused by the war, had increased to 1,200.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since 1914 the Executive was successful in obtaining
the adoption of a new scheme for payment for tying-in
beams, replacing the one which was abolished in 1886,
and giving satisfaction to all workers in the Tapestry
trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The progress and development of the Scotch Association
during the past few years, and the successful
amalgamation with the English Associations, has been
largely due to the tact and energy of the President,
Mr. Thomas Lindsay, of Paisley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Kidderminster, Northern Counties, and Scottish
Associations were amalgamated in November, 1917,
under the title of “The National Affiliation of Carpet
Trade Unions.” The objects of the affiliation were the
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
maintenance of uniform rates, the regulation of the
supply of hands and hours of work, and generally the
regulation of the relations of employers and employed
in the trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The constitution is simple, the control of the Affiliation
being vested in the hands of an Affiliation Board,
composed of three representatives from each Association.
The Board appoints a President, Secretary, and
Treasurer, each Association being entitled to one
official.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the spring and early summer of 1919 negotiations
had been proceeding between the Employers,
the Trade Unions’ representatives, and the Ministry
of Labour for the formation of a Joint Industrial Council
for the Carpet Trade; and the inaugural meeting of this
body was held under the auspices of Mr. John Hodge,
M.P., on 18th July. It was composed as follows —</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> may be of interest to consider briefly the prospects
of the industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Carpet Trade is in several respects a peculiar one.
Its principal raw materials, wool, cotton, and jute, are
of such outstanding importance to more essential
industries, that their supply and their price are conditioned
by the latter; so that the Carpet Trade has to
accommodate itself to a market which is not controlled
to any extent by its own needs. It is not a large
industry; but it employs a number of operatives in whom
a high degree of technical skill is required in a great
variety of branches; and it utilises a considerable
quantity of ingenious machinery of many kinds. It is,
strictly speaking, a luxury trade. That is to say, it is
obvious that it is theoretically more possible to exist
in a house with no carpets, than in a house, say, with
no tables and chairs, while a floor covering is perhaps
less of a necessity than wall-paper or curtains. Of
course, as a matter of fact, the line is not drawn sharply
between carpets and other articles of furnishing. A
person who is furnishing a house, if he can afford curtains
can probably afford carpets, though he may, indeed,
find his mind divided between his desire to provide his
home with a comfort that is almost a necessity, and
his hesitation to indulge himself in a comfort that may
be regarded as a luxury. Where the practical test of
the trade being a luxury trade comes, is in the matter
of renewals. It is here that the Carpet Industry is
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>
sensitive to the periodical changes in commercial prosperity,
which seem to be inherent in modern civilisation.
Generally speaking, when trade is bad the Carpet Industry
is the first to suffer; and when there is a recovery it is
some time before it feels the benefit. It seems that,
with the first pinch of adversity, the carpet consumer
decides upon a policy of economy that excludes the
purchase of carpets, whatever else may or may not be
bought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hence arises a period of depression in the carpet
trade, with a decrease of profitable production, and
consequent unemployment; and this in the future, in
the face of higher wages and more keenly realised
responsibilities towards employees, will certainly be an
even more serious matter than it has been in the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The matter of the import of foreign goods has been
mentioned in the chapter on Hand-made Carpets; and
all that was said therein as regards the unrestricted
entrance into the British market of Eastern and Continental
productions applies to some extent to their
competition with all makes and grades of carpet. The
home market for carpets is a large one normally, but
it is not capable of indefinite expansion; the consumption
has its limits; and if the market is invaded by foreign
goods, the consumption and the price of the domestic
product will quickly fall with unpleasant if not disastrous
results upon the industry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dangers indicated axe real ones, serious alike
for Capital and Labour, who, more than ever in the
past, will have to stand or fall together; and they
deserve consideration, as regards the way in which
they may best be met.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As previously indicated, various Associations exist in
the Carpet Trade; but it may be admitted that there is
scope for better organisation as regards consideration
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
of matters that affect the Industry as a whole. If it is
to be on a firm foundation, there should be a more
complete recognition of the fact that the interests of
all units of the trade are identical. Further, in any
new scheme of combination the position of Labour
will have to be recognised, and its co-operation cordially
welcomed. Some such scheme as is outlined in the
well-known Whitley Report, though it is by no means
free from difficulties, may materialise, possibly in a
modified form. The principle at any rate is a good
one; and carpet manufacturers have had no cause to
complain of their relations with their employees (nor
<span class='it'>vice versâ</span>) in the past, nor any cause for doubting a
reasonable attitude on the part of Trade Unions in the
future. No reasonable employers in the Carpet Trade
will begrudge their employees a fair remuneration for
their work, nor improved conditions of working. Nor,
on the other hand, will they be sorry to admit Trade
Union representatives to a share in dealing with general
trade problems. It seems manifestly right, for instance,
that men no less than masters should consider how the
Industry is affected by tariff questions, or how high
wages or reduced working hours may be made compatible
with the maintenance of the export trade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from this, it remains to be seen whether the
manufacturers themselves can devise any satisfactory
scheme for protecting their own interests and those of
the Industry generally. All are pretty well agreed as
to the desirability of closer and more efficient combination:
differences of opinion exist as to the best
methods by which this may be achieved.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
